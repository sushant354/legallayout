<center><h4>Show Cause Notice:</h4></center>
<section>3.  Accordingly,  a  Show  Cause  Notice  dated  May  20,  2025  (hereinafter  referred  to  as "SCN") was issued to the Noticee, calling upon the Noticee to show cause as to why suitable directions, under Sections 11(1), 11(4) and 11B(1) of SEBI Act, should not be issued against her for the alleged violations and why inquiry should not be held against her under rule 4(1) of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995. SCN was served to the Noticee vide SPAD as well as by email.</section>
<center><h4>Hearing:</h4></center>
<section>4.  Noticee, vide letter dated June 07, 2025, filed her reply to the SCN. Thereafter, in the interest of natural justice, Noticee was granted an opportunity of personal hearing on<blockquote>Order in the matter of Priyanka Yadav - Proprietor of Trade Money Research</blockquote>
 June  27,  2025,  vide  hearing  notice  dated  June  16,  2025.  Since,  the  Noticee  didn't appear for the said hearing, another opportunity of hearing was provided on July 10, 2025, vide hearing notice dated July 02, 2025. AR of the Noticee appeared in the said hearing and reiterated the submissions made vide reply dated June 07, 2025. The AR of the Noticee also submitted that he will produce signed Research Reports sent to the clients along with proof of communication of the same. However, the same is not submitted till date. <blockquote>Page 2 of 27</blockquote>
</section>
<section>5.  Replies: The submissions of the Noticee vide reply dated June 07, 2025 are summarized as below:<blockquote>a)  Change in address was updated to SEBI   through the Intermediary Portal and same was intimated to SEBI Indore local office  through letter posted on 25th July 2024.  The SCN  relied upon  by  the  SEBI pertains  to  the  communication with the BSE and not with the SEBI. Moreover, BSE was not  recognized for administration  and  supervision  of  RAs  at  the  time  of  filing  of  change  in application with the SEBI. The Noticee application was filed with the SEBI and not BSE.</blockquote>
<blockquote>b)  The Noticee was genuinely operating the business from Nagpur, and there was no intention or plan to shift to Indore during the registration phase.</blockquote>
<blockquote>c)  Only  later,  due  to  operational  difficulties  and  lack  of  a  favorable  business situations in Nagpur, the Noticee decided to relocate operations to Indore.</blockquote>
<blockquote>d)  The statement of Mr. Nitin Jain (Lessor of Noticee's Nagpur Office) relied upon by the SEBI as provided in the Annexure B of the SCN, regarding the business operations  were  being  run  by  Sandeep  Yadav  should  not  be  relied  upon  or considered  conclusive  as  Mr.  Nitin  Jain,  being  the  property  owner,  was  not present  at  the  premises  at  all  times  and  therefore  is  not  in  a  position  to accurately state who was  conducting  operations  from  the  said  address  on a Order in the matter of Priyanka Yadav - Proprietor of Trade Money Research</blockquote>
<blockquote>Page 3 of 27 day-today basis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>e)  The  Noticee  categorically  declares  that  Sandeep  Yadav  had  no  involvement whatsoever in the business operations, apart from assisting in documentations and lease formalities.</blockquote>
<blockquote>f)  On the date of SEBI's visit at Noticee's Indore office, neither the Noticee nor Sandeep  Yadav  were  present  at  the  office  premises.  Sandeep  Yadav  was called by the BSE officer on the day of the inspection and was asked to reach the office of Trade Money Research. Upon reaching, there was a power cut at the office premises, following which the SEBI team had taken him to the SEBI Indore Local Office.</blockquote>
<blockquote>g)  The email communication mentioned in Annexure C of the SCN, purportedly written and sent by Sandeep Yadav on 08th October 2024, was not authored or sent by him voluntarily.  The SEBI officer asked from Sandeep Yadav for the email credentials of Trade Money Research belonging to the Noticee who then logged into the email account of the Noticee without her prior consent and sent the  email  to  themselves.  The  email's  content,  vocabulary  &  professionalism reflects  a  professional  tone  that  the  Noticee  or  Sandeep  Yadav  does  not possess  or  use.  The  Noticee  requests  SEBI  to  verify  the  IP  address  and geolocation from which the email in Annexure C of the SCN was sent.</blockquote>
<blockquote>h)  The  compliance  audit  of  F.Y.  2023-24  was  under  the  process  at  the  time  of inspection  and  hence  the  report  could  not  be  submitted  at  the  time  of inspection. Regulation 25(3) mandates the conduct of an annual audit but does not specify any particular deadline/submission date for such a report.</blockquote>
<blockquote>i)  All  complaints  received  through  SCORES  platform  have  been  duly  and promptly  responded  to  within  the  prescribed  timelines.  Additionally,  any grievance or concern raised internally by clients via email, WhatsApp, or phone has been promptly addressed and resolved.</blockquote>
<blockquote>j)  The  Noticee  would  like  to  clarify  that,  at  no  point,  Sandeep  Yadav  was Order in the matter of Priyanka Yadav - Proprietor of Trade Money Research</blockquote>
<blockquote>Page 4 of 27 associated or involved in formulating, approving, or distributing any research services or other ancillary activities.</blockquote>
<blockquote>k)  With  respect  to  the  display  of  SEBI  certificate  and  grievance  redressal mechanism at  its office premises, the same was already affixed at the office premises, particularly inside the cabins where client interactions are handled.</blockquote>
</section>
<section>6.  Accordingly, I note that the SCN and Hearing Notice were duly served to the Noticee. Further, an opportunity of personal hearing was also given to the Noticee, which was availed by her. Hence, the principles of natural justice were complied with respect to the  Noticee  and  I  shall  now  proceed  to  deal  with  the  issues  involved  in  the  instant matter.</section>
<center><h4>Consideration of Issues and Findings:</h4></center>
<section>7.  I  have  carefully  perused  SCN,  the  submissions  made  by  the  Noticee,  documents available on record and the following issues require consideration:<center><h4>A.  Whether the Noticee has violated the relevant provisions of RA Regulations</h4></center>
<center><h4>and  SEBI  Master  Circular  Ref.  No.  SEBI/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD-PoD-</h4></center>
<center><h4>1/P/CIR/2024/49 dated May 21, 2024?</h4></center>
<center><h4>B.  If  the  answer  to  the  above  issue  is  in  affirmative,  what  directions,  if  any,</h4></center>
</section>
<center><h4>including monetary penalty, is required to be imposed on the Noticee?</h4></center>
<section>8.  I note that for the purpose of ease and clarity, issue at "A" has been divided into six</section>
<section>(6) sub issues. Each sub issue will be discussed below in separate headings.</section>
<section>9.  I now proceed to consider the matter on merits.<blockquote>Order in the matter of Priyanka Yadav - Proprietor of Trade Money Research</blockquote>
<blockquote>Page 5 of 27 out  RA  activities  from  Indore  while  obtaining  RA  registration  from  Nagpur,  in violation of Regulation 13(ii) of RA Regulations?</blockquote>
</section>
<section>10. The allegation against the Noticee is that she obtained her RA registration by providing a  Nagpur  address  while  her  actual  business  activities  were  conducted  from  Indore without  providing  any  intimation  to  SEBI/  RAASB,  and  this  was  alleged  to  be  in violation of Regulation 13(ii) of SEBI (Research Analyst) Regulations, 2014.</section>
<section>11. In response, Noticee has submitted that she was genuinely operating the business from  Nagpur  and  had  no  intention  or  plan  to  shift  to  Indore  during  the  registration phase and only later, due to operational difficulties and lack of a favorable business situations in Nagpur, she decided to relocate operations to Indore. The Noticee further submitted that she intimated SEBI of the change in address through the Intermediary portal and by post on July 25, 2024.</section>
<section>12. I note that the Noticee is registered with SEBI as Research Analyst with effect from December  01,  2022  having  place  of  business  as  Nagpur.  During  the  grant  of registration, the Nagpur address of Noticee has been taken on record and accordingly the permission for research advisory activities was granted by SEBI.</section>
<section>13. In this regard, I note that Regulation 13(ii) of the RA Regulation, provides the following:<center><h4>Conditions of certificate.</h4></center>
<blockquote>13.    The  certificate  granted  under  regulation  9  shall,  inter  alia,  be  subject  to  the following conditions:-</blockquote>
<blockquote>(ii)the research analyst shall forthwith inform the Board in writing, if any information or particulars previously submitted to the Board are found to be false or misleading in any material  particular  or  if  there  is  any  material  change  in  the  information  already submitted;</blockquote>
<blockquote>Order in the matter of Priyanka Yadav - Proprietor of Trade Money Research</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Page 6 of 27</blockquote>
</section>
<section>14. As  per  the  available  records  with  SEBI,  the  correspondence  address  and  principal</section>
<p>26,  TC  Chamber,  Scheme  No.54-PU4,  Indore  -  452010  was  mentioned  under Business address details and there was no mention of Nagpur address in the entity's website.</p>
<section>15. Upon examination of the record, it is observed that the Noticee has intimated SEBI's Indore  Local  Office  regarding  the  change  in  her  address  from  Nagpur  to  Indore. Accordingly,  I  find  that  the  allegation  against  the  Noticee  in  this  regard  is  not substantiated.<center><h4>Issue  (b):  Whether  the  Noticee's  activity  was  being carried out  by  Mr.  Sandeep</h4></center>
<center><h4>Yadav, a person debarred by SEBI from dealing in securities market, in violation</h4></center>
</section>
<center><h4>of Section 12 of SEBI Act 1992 r/w Regulation 13 of RA Regulations?</h4></center>
<section>16. It  was  alleged  that  the  Noticee  obtained  registration  from  SEBI  in  her  own  name knowing  that  all  activities  under  the  said  registration  would  be  carried  out  by  her husband,  Mr.  Sandeep  Yadav,  who  has  been  debarred  by  SEBI,  from  dealing  in securities  market.  It  was  further  alleged  that  the  Noticee  knowingly  permitted  Mr. Sandeep Yadav to utilize her SEBI registration for the purpose of conducting activities falling  within  the  scope  of  a  registered  Research  Analyst,  thereby  facilitating  the circumvention of regulatory restrictions imposed upon him. Accordingly, the Noticee was alleged to have violated the provisions of Section 12 of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with Regulation 13 of the SEBI (Research Analyst) Regulations, 2014.</section>
<section>17. I note that Mr. Sandeep Yadav is the sole proprietor of an entity named Capital Vista, which  was  debarred  by  SEBI  vide  order  no.  WTM/ASB/WRO/WRO/23248/2022-23 dated January 30, 2023, for carrying out unregistered investment advisory activities.<blockquote>Order in the matter of Priyanka Yadav - Proprietor of Trade Money Research</blockquote>
 Under the said order, Mr. Sandeep Yadav was directed to refund a sum of ₹89.94 lakh collected from investors through such unregistered activities and was further debarred from accessing the securities market for a period of two years from the date of the order or till the completion of refund to the investors, whichever is later. It is observed that no compliance report in respect of the said directions has been submitted to SEBI by Mr. Sandeep Yadav to date. <blockquote>Page 7 of 27</blockquote>
</section>
<section>18. In her reply to the Show Cause Notice, the Noticee has denied the involvement of Mr. Sandeep  Yadav  in  the  day-to-day  operations  of  the  Research  Analyst  business, except for providing assistance in documentation and lease-related formalities. The Noticee has submitted that on the date of SEBI's visit, neither she nor Mr. Sandeep Yadav  was  present  at  the  office  premises,  and  that  Mr.  Yadav  was  called  to  the Notice's Indore office by a BSE official. Upon arrival and in light of a power outage at the premises, Mr. Yadav went with the SEBI team to the SEBI Indore Local Office, where he was asked to provide the email credentials of the Noticee. It is claimed that one SEBI officer, without the Noticee's prior consent, accessed her email and sent the disputed email to themselves. The Noticee has contended that the content, vocabulary & professionalism of the email shows that it was not written by either of them. She has requested SEBI to conduct a verification of the IP address and geolocation from which the email was sent. The Noticee has further submitted that the statement of Mr. Nitin Jain (Lessor), should not  be  relied  upon  or  considered  conclusive  as  he,  being  the  property  owner  of Noticee's Nagpur office, was not present at the premises at all times and therefore is not  in  a  position  to  accurately  state  who  was  conducting  operations  from  the  said address on a day-to-day basis.<blockquote>Order in the matter of Priyanka Yadav - Proprietor of Trade Money Research</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Page 8 of 27</blockquote>
</section>
<section>19. I  note  that  during  SEBI's  physical  inspection  of  the  Noticee's  office  premises  at Nagpur, the lessor of the said premises, Mr. Nitin Jain, submitted a written statement dated October 08, 2024, wherein he stated that the business activities at the aforesaid premises were being carried out by the Noticee and her husband, Mr. Sandeep Yadav. Further, during SEBI's visit to the Noticee's Indore office, although the Noticee was not present, Mr. Sandeep Yadav, her husband, confirmed the same fact vide an email dated October 08, 2024, as well as through a signed statement of even date, wherein he admitted to managing and operating the business of Trade Money Research. He also admitted that the registration was obtained in the name of the Noticee since there existed an adverse SEBI order against him.</section>
<section>20. In this regard, I note that Mr. Sandeep Yadav, the husband of  the Noticee, not only sent  an  email  dated  October  08,  2024,  wherein  he  admitted  to  managing  and operating  the  business  activities  of  Trade  Money  Research,  but  also  furnished  a separate, duly signed written statement on the same date, which was also provided to the Noticee as an annexure to the SCN. In the said signed statement, Mr. Yadav categorically acknowledged that the registration as a Research Analyst was taken in the name of his wife (i.e., the Noticee) solely because a SCN was issued against him, which precluded him from obtaining registration or operating in the securities market in his own name.</section>
<section>21. The  Noticee  has  sought  to  dispute  the  credibility  of  the  email  communication, contending that neither she nor Mr. Yadav authored the email, and alleging that the same  was  sent  by  a  SEBI  officer using  her  login  credentials,  which  were  allegedly accessed without her prior consent. In support of this assertion, the Noticee argued that  the  email's  vocabulary,  tone,  and  structure  are  inconsistent  with  her  or  Mr. Yadav's usual manner of writing, and has called upon SEBI to conduct a verification of the email's IP address and geolocation.<blockquote>Order in the matter of Priyanka Yadav - Proprietor of Trade Money Research</blockquote>
 allegation that her credentials were misused by SEBI  officials. Nothing stopped the Noticee to discredit this e-mail communication immediately, if such an email was sent without her consent. Noticee was absolutely free to either send an email or another written communication to SEBI recording the facts of her case on the aforesaid email communication.  However,  no  such  subsequent  communication  was  made  by  the Noticee. The dispute on the email was made only on receipt of SCN. Even as per the case of the Noticee, the email credentials were with Mr. Yadav, which means he had access to sending and receiving emails as if it is sent by the Noticee, further diluting Noticees  case  of  no  involvement  of  her  spouse  in  activities  other  than  assisting  in documentations and lease formalities. There is no case that Mr. Yadav called for this login details from his spouse i.e. the Noticee. In view of these circumstances, mere denial cannot be accepted as a valid support of the case of Noticee. <blockquote>Page 9 of 27</blockquote>
</section>
<section>23. With regards to the same, I note that Mr Yadav has also signed a statement on the same date,  wherein  he  has  admitted  to  the very  same facts as  those  stated  in the email. The Noticee has not denied the existence of this signed statement. It does not stand  to  reason  why  the  Noticee,  who  denied  Mr.  Yadav  sending  the  e-mail  dated October  08,  2025,  has  not  denied  the  statement  signed  by  her  spouse.  Therefore, even for the sake of argument, if no reliance is placed on the e-mail, the letter signed by the spouse of the Noticee, Mr. Yadav cannot be brushed aside, more particularly when the same was not denied. In light of this, the arguments raised by the Noticee appears  to  be  an  afterthought  and  is  unconvincing.  Therefore,  I  am  not  inclined  to accept the submissions of the Noticee in this regard.</section>
<section>24. In the above context, it is relevant to note the admission of the Noticee on this issue, which are as follows:<blockquote>Order in the matter of Priyanka Yadav - Proprietor of Trade Money Research</blockquote>
<blockquote>Page 10 of 27 "I am running the operation of Trade Money Research at the aforementioned address in Indore.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I took registration from Nagpur address in name of my wife as obtaining registration from Indore was difficult as I was issued SCN in the matter of Capital Vista somewhere in 2016 from Indore Local Office. Further, obtaining registration of Investment Adviser was difficult due to regulatory compliances.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I submit that my wife has no role in the operations of the Trade Money Research which is registered with SBEI as RA and she is the proprietor of Trade Money Research just on paper."</blockquote>
</section>
<section>25. Further, with regard to the Noticee's submission that the statement of Mr. Nitin Jain, the  lessor  of  the  premises  at  Nagpur,  should  not  be  relied  upon  or  considered conclusive, I note that even in her own submission, the Noticee has stated that  Mr. Jain was not present at the premises at all times, which by implication suggests that he was present on certain occasions. In my view, even occasional presence at the premises  would have provided  Mr. Jain  with  sufficient  exposure  to  observe  who  all were involved in the business operations conducted from the said premises.</section>
<section>26.  Noticee also did not ask for the cross examination of this statement. Further, there are no facts on record including from the reply of the Noticee to discredit the statement of Mr. Jain.</section>
<section>27. Therefore,  while  Mr.  Jain's  statement  may  not,  in  isolation,  be  conclusive,  it  does possess corroborative value, in my view, especially when considered in conjunction with  the  direct  admission  made  by  Mr.  Sandeep  Yadav  in  both  the  email  and  the signed statement.<blockquote>Order in the matter of Priyanka Yadav - Proprietor of Trade Money Research</blockquote>
 lessor's statement. On the contrary, I consider it to be a corroborative material which further substantiates the conclusion that Mr. Sandeep Yadav was actively involved in the operations of the Noticee. <blockquote>Page 11 of 27</blockquote>
</section>
<section>29. In light of the above observations, I am of the view that Noticee obtained registration from SEBI in her own name knowing that all activities under the said registration would be carried out by her husband, Mr. Sandeep Yadav, who has been debarred by SEBI, from  dealing  in  securities  market  and  in  essence,  Noticee  offered  her  identity  for securing  the  registration  certificate,  while  her husband  despite  his disability  offered service through her registration certificate.</section>
<section>30. I note that Section 12 of SEBI Act, 1992, among others, states the following:<center><h4>REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE</h4></center>
<center><h4>Registration of stock brokers, sub-brokers, share transfer agents, etc.</h4></center>
<blockquote>12. (1) No stock broker, sub-broker, share transfer agent, banker to an issue, trustee of trust deed, registrar to an issue, merchant banker, underwriter, portfolio manager, investment adviser and such other intermediary who may be associated with securities market shall buy, sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance with, the conditions of a certificate of registration obtained from the Board in accordance with the 53[regulations] made under this Act.</blockquote>
 Further, Regulation 13 of the RA Regulations, mentions:<center><h4>Conditions of certificate.</h4></center>
<blockquote>13.  The  certificate  granted  under  regulation  9  shall, inter  alia,  be  subject  to  the following conditions:-</blockquote>
<blockquote>(i)the research analyst shall abide by the provisions of the Act and these regulations;</blockquote>
<blockquote>Order in the matter of Priyanka Yadav - Proprietor of Trade Money Research</blockquote>
<blockquote>Page 12 of 27 (ii)the research analyst shall forthwith inform the Board in writing, if any information or particulars previously submitted to the Board are found to be false or misleading in any material  particular  or  if  there  is  any  material  change  in  the  information  already submitted;</blockquote>
 …</section>
<section>31. From the above, I note that Section 12(1) of the SEBI Act mandates that no person shall act as a Research Analyst unless he/she obtains a certificate of registration and one of the implied conditions of registration is that the registered entity must personally conduct  or  oversee  the  regulated  activities  in  a  compliant  and  lawful  manner.  By permitting  the  actual  operation  of  the  RA  business  to  managed  by  Mr.  Sandeep Yadav, who is not only unregistered but also debarred by SEBI, the Noticee failed to uphold the fundamental condition that a SEBI registration must be used for operation by the registered individual only and accordingly, I find that the Noticee has violated the provision of Section 12 of SEBI Act 1992. Further, by not complying with Section 12  of  the  SEBI  Act  1992,  the  Noticee  has  also  violated  regulation  13  of  RA Regulations.<center><h4>Issue (c): Whether by having association with Mr. Sandeep Yadav, the Noticee has</h4></center>
<center><h4>misdirected the consideration of SEBI for grant of certificate of registration under</h4></center>
<center><h4>Regulation 6(vii) and 6(x) and contravened the conditions for grant of registration</h4></center>
</section>
<center><h4>Regulation 13(i) of RA Regulations?</h4></center>
<section>32. I note that Regulation 6(vii) and 6(x) of the RA Regulations, provides that:<blockquote>Order in the matter of Priyanka Yadav - Proprietor of Trade Money Research</blockquote>
<blockquote>Page 13 of 27 Consideration of application and eligibility criteria.</blockquote>
<blockquote>6.  For the purpose of the grant of certificate the Board shall take into account all matters which are relevant to the grant of certificate of registration and in particular the following, namely:-</blockquote>
 …<blockquote>(vii)whether  the  applicant,  individuals  employed  as  research  analyst,  persons associated  with  research  services]  and  partners  of  the  applicant,  if  any,  are  fit  and proper persons based on the criteria as specified in Schedule II of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008;</blockquote>
 …<blockquote>(x)whether any disciplinary action has been taken by the Board or any other regulatory authority  against  the  applicant  or  any  person  directly  or  indirectly  connected  to  the applicant under the respective Act, rules or regulations made thereunder.</blockquote>
 … Further, Regulation 13 of the RA Regulations, provides the following:<center><h4>Conditions of certificate.</h4></center>
<blockquote>13.  The certificate granted under regulation 9 shall, inter alia, be subject to the following conditions:-</blockquote>
<blockquote>(i)the research analyst shall abide by the provisions of the Act and these regulations;</blockquote>
<blockquote>(ii)the research analyst shall forthwith inform the Board in writing, if any information or particulars previously submitted to the Board are found to be false or misleading in any material  particular  or  if  there  is  any  material  change  in  the  information  already submitted;</blockquote>
 …</section>
<section>33. I note that the 'fit and proper' criteria include considerations such as integrity, honesty, reputation,  and  absence  of  adverse  regulatory  findings.  However,  the  Noticee's association with Mr. Sandeep Yadav, for the research analyst activities knowing that<blockquote>Order in the matter of Priyanka Yadav - Proprietor of Trade Money Research</blockquote>
 he  has  been  debarred  by  SEBI  for  unregistered  investment  advisory  activities  and whose refund obligation has not been complied with yet, is a material adverse factor. <blockquote>Page 14 of 27</blockquote>
</section>
<section>34. In this regard, Noticee has contended that Mr. Sandeep Yadav have no association with the operations of Noticee or Trade Money Research and was merely having a personal  relationship  as  her  spouse,  which  does  not  translate  to  regulatory involvement.  I  note  that  it  is  clearly  established  in  the  preceding  paras  that  Mr. Sandeep Yadav is not only the spouse of the Noticee but infact he was the one who was  carrying  out  Noticee's  activities  as  a  RA,  using  the  certificate  obtained  in  her name. Therefore, I find no merit in the aforesaid contention of the Noticee.  By having association  with  a  debarred  person  for  conduct  of  research  analyst  activities  and concealing the same, the Noticee, effectively misdirected the consideration of SEBI under Regulation 6(x) of RA Regulations.</section>
<section>35. I also note that at the time of registration, the Noticee did not disclose that the business would be operated by her husband, who was already under regulatory sanction which tantamount to concealment of material fact, as the presence of a debarred person in control  of  RA  functions  would  have  directly  impacted  SEBI's  decision  to  grant registration.  It  is  relevant  to  note  that  there  is  mandatory  requirement  under  the information  to  be  provided  at  the  time  of  filing  application  for  grant  of  certificate  of registration   on "Whether any disciplinary action has been taken by the Board or any other regulatory authority against any person directly or indirectly connected with the applicant under the Act or the regulations made thereunder in the last 5 years" under clause 5(b) of Form A in First Schedule of RA Regulations. However, the Noticee has not  given  that  information  as  Mr.  Sandeep  Yadav  is  a  connected  person  and disciplinary action was taken against him by SEBI on January 30, 2023. Therefore, by failing to provide this necessary information, the Noticee, effectively misdirected the consideration of SEBI under Regulation 6(x) of RA Regulations.<blockquote>Order in the matter of Priyanka Yadav - Proprietor of Trade Money Research</blockquote>

 …</section>
<section>38. I note from the aforementioned regulation that it mandates a RA to disclose all material information to its clients to take an informed investment decision. In the present case, the  Noticee  concealed  to  its  clients  that  Mr. Sandeep  Yadav,  debarred  by  SEBI,  is associated in her business activities. In essence, the investors are not aware that the service  they  are  getting  from  a  person,  has  been  debarred  from  securities  market including  giving  any  research  analyst  service.  I  note  that  this  constitutes  a concealment of material information which is in violation of Regulation 19 of the RA Regulations.</section>
<section>39. In relation to the above allegation, the Noticee has submitted that Mr. Sandeep Yadav<blockquote>Order in the matter of Priyanka Yadav - Proprietor of Trade Money Research</blockquote>
 client  about  Sandeep  Yadav  does  not  arise.  As  explained  above,  it  is  already established that Mr. Sandeep Yadav was the person at the helm of the RA business being conducted in the name of the Noticee. Therefore, I find no merit in the aforesaid contention of the Noticee. <blockquote>Page 16 of 27</blockquote>
</section>
<section>40. In view of the above, I find that by concealing to its clients that the operations of the entity  are  being  run  by  a  person  debarred  by  SEBI,  the  Noticee  has  violated Regulation 19 of the RA Regulations.<center><h4>Issue (e): Whether the Noticee has failed to conduct annual audit from the member</h4></center>

</section>
<center><h4>Regulations, 2014?</h4></center>
<section>41. It  was  observed  that  the  Noticee,  in  response  to  the  Pre  Inspection  Questionnaire<ul>
<li>(PIQ), had failed to submit annual audit report for the inspection period, as required in terms of RA Regulations. Therefore, it was alleged that the Noticee failed to conduct annual  audit  from  the  member  of  ICAI/  ICSI  and  thereby,  violated  the  provision  of Regulation 25(3) of RA Regulations.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>42. I note that Regulation 25(3) of RA Regulations provides the following:<center><h4>Maintenance of records.</h4></center>
<blockquote>25(3)  Research  analyst  or  research  entity  shall  conduct  annual  audit  in  respect  of compliance with these regulations from a member of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India or Institute of Company Secretaries of India 42[or Institute of Cost Accountants of India and submit the report of the same in such manner as may be specified by the Board]</blockquote>
 …<blockquote>Order in the matter of Priyanka Yadav - Proprietor of Trade Money Research</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Page 17 of 27</blockquote>
</section>
<section>43. For  the  said  allegation  Noticee  has  contended  that  she  has  duly  completed  the compliance audit for the F.Y. 2022-23 and as the compliance audit of F.Y. 2023-24 was  under  process  at  the  time  of  inspection,  it  could  not  be  submitted  during inspection.  Noticee  has  further  submitted  that  Regulation  25(3)  of  RA  Regulations mandates  the  conduct  of  an  annual  audit  but  does  not  specify  any  particular deadline/submission date for such a report.</section>
<section>44. In this regard, the requirement to conduct the audit would mean conduct of an audit and preparation of report pursuant to audit. I note that while Regulation 25(3) does not lay  down  a  specific  deadline  for  submission  of  the  audit  report,  it  does  impose  a continuing obligation to conduct an annual audit  and consequently the audit report. Without audit report the process of audit has no meaning. Therefore, the audit report should be ready within reasonable time from the end of financial year for which the audit is undertaken.</section>
<section>45. In  the  instant  case,  the  audit  report  for  FY  2023-24  has  been  submitted  only subsequently, along with the reply dated June 07, 2025, in response to the SCN. The audit  report  does  not  mention  the  date  of  appointment  of  the  auditor.  Nor  did  the company  produce  any  document  evidencing  the  auditor's  appointment  to  establish that  the  audit  process  was  already  underway  as  on  the  date  of  SEBI's  inspection. These circumstances clearly indicate that the auditor was not appointed prior to the date of inspection. It points to the fact that appointment has been made only after the SEBI inspection had commenced. If the case of the Noticee is accepted, then the audit has taken almost 6 months for completion. I note that the said audit report bears the date April 10, 2025 which is more than a year after the close of the relevant financial year which cannot be considered to be reasonable period.  The purported time taken to complete the audit further undermines that the audit report process was not imitated during the time of inspection.<blockquote>Order in the matter of Priyanka Yadav - Proprietor of Trade Money Research</blockquote>
 requirement under Regulation 25(3) of the  RA Regulations to  conduct annual audit from  the  member  of  ICAI  /  ICSI.  Accordingly,  the  allegation  that  the  Noticee  has violated Regulation 25(3) of the RA Regulations stands established.<blockquote>Page 18 of 27 Issue (f): Whether the Noticee has failed to comply with requirements relating to investor  grievance  mechanism  and  updation  of  the  same  on  the  website,  in violation of Point No. 4.2 of SEBI Master Circular Ref.

</section>
<section>47. It was alleged that the Noticee failed to maintain grievance register for the complaints lodged through SCORES and complaints received directly from the clients. Also, at the time of inspection at Nagpur as well as at Indore location, it  was observed that there  was  no  display  of  SEBI  registration  certificate  and  grievance  redressal mechanism at office premises. Further, on website of the RA, there was no display of accurate  and  updated  investor  complaints  details,  as  required.  Hence,  the  Noticee was  alleged  to  have  violated  Point  No.  4.2  of  SEBI  Master  Circular  Ref.  No. SEBI/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD-PoD-1/P/CIR/2024/49  dated  May  21,  2024  (originally introduced vide SEBI Circular No. CIR/MIRSD/3/2014 dated August 28, 2014, which has  been  subsumed  under  the  said  Master  Circular)  and  Regulation  26A  of  SEBI Research Analysts Regulation 2014.</section>
<section>48. In this regard, the Noticee has submitted that there is no specific requirement under the  SEBI  Research  Analyst  Regulations,  2014,  or  the  applicable  circulars  that mandates maintenance of a grievance register for the complaints. Noticee has further submitted that all complaints received through SCORES platform have been duly and promptly responded to within the prescribed timelines and any grievance or concern raised  internally  by  clients  via  email,  WhatsApp,  or  phone  has  been  promptly<blockquote>Order in the matter of Priyanka Yadav - Proprietor of Trade Money Research</blockquote>
 addressed and resolved. With respect to the display of SEBI certificate and grievance redressal mechanism at office premises, the Noticee has submitted that the same was already  affixed  at  the  office  premises,  particularly  inside  the  cabins  where  client interactions are handled and no evidence on record has been brought up by the SEBI showcasing  non-compliance  of  the  same  by  the  Noticee.  Noticee  submitted  a photograph  of  SEBI  registration  certificate  and  grievance  redressal  mechanism, displayed at a wall. <blockquote>Page 19 of 27</blockquote>

<section>49. I note that Regulation 26A of RA Regulations provides the following:<blockquote>26A.

</section>
<section>51. I note that Regulation 26A of the SEBI (Research Analyst) Regulations, 2014 requires all  disputes  between  a  research  analyst  or  research  entity  and  its  clients  to  be submitted  to  a  dispute  resolution  mechanism  in  accordance  with  the  procedure specified  by  SEBI.  Master  Circular  dated  May  21,  2024  (bearing  Ref.  No. SEBI/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD-PoD-1/P/CIR/2024/49),  provides  under  Point  No.  4.2,  that research  analysts  shall  prominently  display  in  their  offices  the  grievance  redressal mechanism  available  to  investors,  including  contact  information  of  the  compliance officer, CEO/proprietor, and SEBI's SCORES platform.</section>
<section>52. With  regards  to  the  same,  the  Noticee  has  submitted  that  the  requisite  information was displayed inside the office cabins where client interactions are handled. Further, the Noticee has submitted a photograph evidencing such display, including the SEBI registration certificate and the grievance redressal mechanism signage, prominently affixed to a wall.</section>
<section>53. In  this  regard,  I  note  that  no  direct  evidence  has  been  brought  on  record  to conclusively establish that the required display information was completely absent at the time of inspection, particularly in view of the submissions made by the Noticee. In light  of  the  above,  I  am  inclined  to  accept  Noticee's  submission  that  the  SEBI registration  certificate  and  grievance  redressal  mechanism  were  displayed  at  the office premises. Accordingly, I am of the view that the charge of non-compliance on this specific aspect does not stand established.<blockquote>Order in the matter of Priyanka Yadav - Proprietor of Trade Money Research</blockquote>
 investor complaints details on their website under Regulation 26A of RA Regulations or  under  Point  No.  4.2  of  SEBI  Master  Circular  Ref.  No.  SEBI/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD- PoD-1/P/CIR/2024/49 May 21, 2024, as alleged. <blockquote>Page 21 of 27</blockquote>
</section>
<section>55. In view of the above, I find that the allegations w.r.t. violation of Point No. 4.2 of SEBI Master Circular Ref. No. SEBI/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD-PoD-1/P/CIR/2024/49 dated May 21, 2024, read with Regulation 26A of RA Regulations is not established.</section>
<section>56. In view of the afore mentioned observations, it stands established that the Noticee, while registered as a Research Analyst under the SEBI RA Regulations, has acted in violation of various regulatory provisions above mentioned. The Noticee's association with a person debarred by SEBI from accessing the securities market is fraught with grave  concern  as  running  its  business  activities  through  debarred  person  puts  at naught  all  the  protections  given  to  the  recipients  of  research  advisory  service.  The debarment order of SEBI in essence prevents the persons debarred, from extending any service to investors and investors are at peril when they receive their service from those  persons.  Further,  the  Noticee  failed  to  provide  this  necessary  information, misdirecting the consideration of SEBI. The Noticee also failed to conduct and make available the annual audit for the relevant period during the inspection and concealed to its clients that the operations of the entity are being run by a person debarred by SEBI.</section>
</section>
<section>57. However, with respect to the allegation regarding failure to intimate SEBI about the change  in  address,  the  same  does  not  stand  established.  Similarly,  the  allegation concerning  non-display  of  SEBI  registration  certificate  and  grievance  redressal mechanism at the office premises is also not substantiated, in view of the evidence subsequently  submitted  by  the  Noticee  and  lack  of  contrary  material  to  discredit evidence given by the Noticee. Accordingly, these two allegations merit the benefit of<blockquote>Order in the matter of Priyanka Yadav - Proprietor of Trade Money Research</blockquote>
 doubt.<blockquote>Page 22 of 27 B.  If  the  answer  to  the  above  issue  is  in  affirmative,  what  directions,  if  any, including monetary penalty, is required to be imposed on the Noticee?</blockquote>
</section>
<section>58. I note that the SCN has called upon the Noticee to show cause as to why appropriate penalty be not imposed upon her under Section 15EB of SEBI Act for the violations alleged in the SCN. Section 15 EB of the SEBI Act are extracted hereunder: - Section  15  EB  -  Penalty  for  default  in  case  of  investment  adviser  and  research analyst</section>
<blockquote>"Where an investment adviser or a research analyst fails to comply with the regulations made by the Board or directions issued by the Board, such investment adviser or research analyst shall be liable to penalty which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues subject to a maximum of one crore rupees."</blockquote>
</section>
<section>59. In view of the non-compliances of the respective regulations above found, the Noticee is liable to penalty under Section 15 EB of SEBI Act.  While determining the quantum of  penalty  under  the  SEBI  Act,  it  is  important  to  consider  among  other factors,  the factors specifically stipulated in section 15J of the SEBI Act which are as follows: - a.  the  amount  of  disproportionate  gain  or  unfair  advantage,  wherever  quantifiable, made as a result of the default; b.  the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c.  the repetitive nature of the default<blockquote>Order in the matter of Priyanka Yadav - Proprietor of Trade Money Research</blockquote>
 debarment  order  of  SEBI  is  to  prevent  the  person  debarred  from  undertaking securities market activity. It is also preventive in a sense that the prospective investors do  not  get  exposed  to  the  services  of  the  persons  who  are  debarred.  If  debarred persons  are  permitted  to  be  sheltered  behind  another  person,  as  in  this  case  of Noticee providing shelter and acting as front in the eyes of the unsuspecting investors, the very purpose of not only the debarment order is defeated but also the purpose that such  debarred  entities  cannot  offer  securities  market  related  services  also  get defeated. Consequently, it is not only the investor, who are directly coming into contact with those fronts, are adversely affected but the investor confidence in market eco- system  also  goes for a fall. Therefore,  actions  of  Noticee destabilises  an  important part  of  the  edifice  of  investor  confidence  on  which  the  securities  market  stands. Therefore, in the interest of investors, and orderly development of securities market, which  requires  protection  of  investor  confidence,  appropriate  directions  need  to  be passed in the instant case. <blockquote>Page 23 of 27</blockquote>
</section>
<section>61. While  the  quantified  loss  or  gain  mentioned  in  section  15J  of  SEBI  Act  are  not  on record, the erosion to investor confidence is one of the aggravating factors that should be taken into account while arriving at the penalty amount. While the association of debarred person in the Noticee's business is serious, some of the alleged violations such as failure to inform the change of office address and display of SEBI registration certificate  and  grievance  redressed  mechanism  at  office  premises  were  not established.  Therefore,  keeping  in  mind  the  nature  and  gravity  of  the  violations established and the mitigating factors discussed herein. I find that the Noticee is liable to be imposed with appropriate penalty under Section 15EB of the SEBI Act.<blockquote>Order in the matter of Priyanka Yadav - Proprietor of Trade Money Research</blockquote>
