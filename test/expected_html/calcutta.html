<p>Mr. Lokesh Chezian N. … for the petitioner Mr. Rakesh Kumar</p>
<p>… for the respondents August 28, 2025 [AKB] Item No.4</p>
<p>The  petitioner  has  preferred  the  present  writ  petition being  aggrieved  by  the  inaction  of  the  respondents  in  not deciding her application for release of the pensionary benefits of her  late  husband  U.  Balakrishnan,  who  was  serving  as  a Sanitary Mazdoor under Sri Vijaya Puram Council.</p>
<p>The  husband  of  the  petitioner  expired  on  20.03.2024 leaving  behind  the  petitioner  (wife)  and  three  children  and  his mother  as  surviving  dependents.  The  petitioner  obtained  a Family  Member  Certificate  dated  15.04.2025 from the Tehsildar,  Sri  Vijaya  Puram  Tehsil,  South  Andaman.  On  the basis  of  the  said  certificate,  she  applied  for  release  of  her pensionary benefits.</p>
<p>The respondent No.3, however, vide communication dated 30.04.2025,  directed  the  petitioner  to  produce  a  Legal  Heir Certificate.  The  petitioner  contends  that  since  she  had  already submitted  a  Family  Membership  Certificate,  there  was  no requirement for producing a separate Legal Heir Certificate, and accordingly  she  submitted  a  representation  dated  08.05.2025 requesting the respondents to release the pensionary benefits.</p>
<p>This  Court  has  heard  the  arguments  advanced  by  the counsel  for  the  petitioner  and  has  perused  the  materials  on record.</p>
<p>It  is  evident  that  the  respondents  are  insisted  upon submission of a Legal Heir Certificate in terms of the governing rules/procedure for settlement of pensionary benefits.</p>
<p>It  is  a  well-settled  principle  that  a  Family  Membership Certificate  and  a  Legal  Heir  Certificate  are  distinct  documents serving  different  purposes.  A  Family  Membership  Certificate  is ordinarily issued by the Revenue or Tehsil authorities to certify the  individuals  who  constitute  a  person's  family  for  general identification  and  administrative  purposes.  This  certificate typically  includes  the  names  of  parents,  spouse,  children,  and siblings. However, the inclusion of a person's name in a Family Membership Certificate does not automatically confer any right of  inheritance.  In  contrast,  a  Legal  Heir  Certificate  is  issued specifically to establish the lawful heirs of a deceased person. It is  a  mandatory  document  for  the  settlement  of  pensionary benefits,  service  dues,  and  other  claims  arising  out  of succession. Its purpose is to safeguard against rival claims and disputes  relating  to  inheritance.  This  certificate  contains  only the  names  of  those  individuals  who  are  legally  recognized  as heirs  of  the  deceased  under  the  applicable  personal  or succession  laws.  Accordingly,  both  certificates  are  separate  in nature and serve different legal and administrative functions.</p>
<p>In  the  present  case,  the  petitioner  has  admittedly  not produced  the  Legal  Heir  Certificate  as  required  by  the respondents.  Without  such  certificate,  the  respondents  cannot be  compelled  to  process  the  claim,  since  release  of  pensionary benefits in the absence of Legal Heir Certificate would not only be  contrary  to  the  established  rules  but  may  also  expose  the authorities  to  multiplicity  of  claims  or  potential  disputes  in future.</p>
<p>This  Court,  therefore,  finds  no  infirmity  in  the  action  of the  respondents  in  keeping  the  petitioner's  application  in abeyance till the Legal Heir Certificate is furnished.</p>
<p>The  petitioner  is  at  liberty  to  obtain  and  produce  the Legal  Heir  Certificate  before  the  competent  authority,  upon which  the  respondents  shall  process  and  disburse  the pensionary benefits as expeditiously as possible, in accordance with law.</p>
<p>In view of the same, there is no merit in the present writ petition and the same is dismissed.</p>
