<center><h4>The international interest</h4></center>
<p>1.  This  convention  provides  for  the  constitution  and  effects  of  an international  interest  in  certain  categories  of  mobile  equipment  and  associated rights.</p>
<p>2. For the purposes of this Convention, an international interest in mobile equipment  is an interest,  constituted under  Article 7,  in  a uniquely  identifiable object of a category of such objects listed in paragraph 3 and designated in the Protocol:</p>
<p>(a) granted by the chargor under a security agreement;</p>
<p>(b)  vested  in  a  person  who  is  the  conditional  seller  under  a  title reservation agreement; or (c) vested in a person who is the lessor under a leasing agreement.</p>
<p>An  interest  falling  within  sub-paragraph  (a)  does  not  also  fall  within sub-paragraph (b) or (c).</p>
<p>3. The categories referred to in the preceding paragraphs are:</p>
<p>(a) airframes, aircraft engines and helicopters;</p>
<p>(b) railway rolling stock; and (c) space assets.</p>
<p>4. The applicable law determines whether an interest to which paragraph 2 applies falls within sub-paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) of that paragraph.</p>
<p>5. An international interest in an object extends to proceeds of that object.</p>
<center><h4>Article 3</h4></center>
<center><h4>Sphere of application</h4></center>
<p>1.  This  Convention  applies  when,  at  the  time  of  the  conclusion  of  the agreement creating or providing for the international interest, the debtor is situated in a Contracting State.</p>
<p>2. The fact that the creditor is situated in a non-Contracting State does not affect the applicability of this Convention.</p>
<center><h4>Article 4</h4></center>
<center><h4>Where debtor is situated</h4></center>
<p>1. For the purposes of Article 3(1), the debtor is situated in any Contracting State:</p>
<p>(a) under the law of which it is incorporated or formed;</p>
<p>(b) where it has its registered office or statutory seat;</p>
<p>(c) where it has its center of administration; or (d) where it has its place of business.</p>
<p>2. A reference in sub-paragraph (d) of the preceding paragraph to the debtor's place of business shall, if it has more than one place of business, mean its principal place of business or, if it has no place of business, its habitual residence.</p>
<center><h4>Article 5</h4></center>
<center><h4>Interpretation and applicable law</h4></center>
<p>1. In the interpretation of this convention, regard is to be had to its purposes as  set  forth  in  the  preamble,  to  its  international  character  and  to  the  need  to promote uniformity and predictability in its application.</p>
<p>2. Questions concerning matters governed by this convention which are not expressly settled in it are to be settled in conformity with the general principles on which it is based or, in the absence of such principles, in conformity with the applicable law.</p>
<p>3.  References  to  the  applicable  law  are  to  the  domestic  rules  of  the  law applicable by virtue of the rules of private international law of the forum State.</p>
<p>4. Where a State comprises several territorial units, each of which has its own  rules  of  law  in  respect of  the  matter  to  be decided,  and where  there is no indication of the relevant territorial unit, the law of that State decides which is the territorial unit whose rules shall govern. In the absence of any such rule, the law of the territorial unit with which the case is most closely connected shall apply.</p>
<center><h4>Article 6</h4></center>
<center><h4>Relationship between the Convention and the Protocol</h4></center>
<p>1. This Convention and the Protocol shall be read and interpreted together as a single instrument.</p>
<p>2.  To  the  extent  of  any  inconsistency  between  this  Convention  and  the Protocol, the Protocol shall prevail.</p>
<center><h4>CHAPTER II</h4></center>
<center><h4>CONSTITUTION OF AN INTERNATIONAL INTEREST</h4></center>
<center><h4>Article 7</h4></center>
<center><h4>Formal requirements</h4></center>
<p>An interest is constituted as an international interest under this convention where the agreement creating or providing for the interest:</p>
<p>(a) is in writing;</p>
<p>(b) relates to an object of which the chargor, conditional seller or lessor has power to dispose;</p>
<p>(c) enables the object to be identified in conformity with the Protocol; and (d) in the case of a security agreement, enables the secured obligations to  be  determined,  but  without  the  need  to  state  a  sum  or  maximum  sum secured.</p>
<center><h4>CHAPTER III</h4></center>
<center><h4>DEFAULT REMEDIES</h4></center>
<center><h4>Article 8</h4></center>
<center><h4>Remedies of chargee</h4></center>
<p>1. In the event of default as provided in Article 11, the chargee may, to the extent that the chargor has at any time so agreed and subject to any declaration that may be made by a Contracting State under Article 54, exercise any one or more of the following remedies:</p>
<p>(a) take possession or control of any object charged to it;</p>
<p>(b) sell or grant a lease of any such object;</p>
<p>(c) collect or receive any income or profits arising from the management or use of any such object.</p>
<p>2.  The  chargee  may  alternatively  apply  for  a  court  order  authorising  or directing any of the acts referred to in the preceding paragraph.</p>
<p>3. Any remedy set out in sub-paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) of paragraph 1 or by Article  13  shall  be  exercised  in  a  commercially  reasonable  manner.  A  remedy shall be deemed to be exercised in a commercially reasonable manner where it is exercised in conformity with a provision of the security agreement except where such a provision is manifestly unreasonable.</p>
<p>4. A chargee proposing to sell or grant a lease of an object under paragraph 1 shall give reasonable prior notice in writing of the proposed sale or lease to:</p>
<p>(a) interested persons specified in Article 1(m)(i) and (ii); and (b)  interested  persons  specified  in  Article  1(m)(iii)  who  have  given notice of their rights to the chargee within a reasonable time prior to the sale or lease.</p>
<p>5. Any sum collected or received by the chargee as a result of exercise of any of the remedies set out in paragraph 1 or 2 shall be applied towards discharge of the amount of the secured obligations.</p>
<p>6. Where the sums collected or received by the chargee as a result of the exercise of any remedy set out in paragraph 1 or 2 exceed the amount secured by the security interest and any reasonable costs incurred in the exercise of any such remedy, then unless otherwise ordered by the court the chargee shall distribute the surplus  among  holders  of  subsequently  ranking  interests  which  have  been registered or of which the chargee has been given notice, in order of priority, and pay any remaining balance to the chargor.</p>
<center><h4>Article 9</h4></center>
<center><h4>Vesting of object in satisfaction; redemption</h4></center>
<p>1. At any time after default as provided in Article 11, the chargee and all the interested  persons  may  agree  that  ownership  of  (or  any  other  interest  of  the chargor in) any object covered by the security interest shall vest in the chargee in or towards satisfaction of the secured obligations.</p>
<p>2. The court may on the application of the chargee order that ownership of (or any other interest of the chargor in) any object covered by the security interest shall vest in the chargee in or towards satisfaction of the secured obligations.</p>
<p>3. The court shall grant an application under the preceding paragraph only if  the  amount  of  the  secured  obligations  to  be  satisfied  by  such  vesting  is commensurate with the value of the object after taking account of any payment to be made by the chargee to any of the interested persons.</p>
<p>4. At any time after default as provided  under Article 11 and before sale of the charged object or the making of an order under paragraph 2, the chargor or any  interested  person  may  discharge  the  security  interest  by  paying  in  full  the amount secured, subject to any lease granted by the chargee under Article 8(1)(b) or ordered under Article 8(2). Where, after such default, the payment of the amount secured is made in full by an interested person other than the debtor, that person is subrogated to the rights of the chargee.</p>
<p>5. Ownership or any other interest of the chargor passing on a sale under Article 8(1)(b) or passing under paragraph 1 or 2 of this article is free from any other  interest  over  which  the  chargee's  security  interest  has  priority  under  the provisions of Article 29.</p>
<center><h4>Article 10</h4></center>
<center><h4>Remedies of conditional seller or lessor</h4></center>
<p>In the event of default under a title reservation agreement or under a leasing agreement as provided in Article 11, the conditional seller or the lessor, as the case may be, may:</p>
<p>(a) subject to any declaration that may be made by a Contracting State under Article 54, terminate the agreement and take possession or control of any object to which the agreement relates; or (b) apply for a court order authorising or directing either of these acts.</p>
<center><h4>Article 11</h4></center>
<center><h4>Meaning of default</h4></center>
<p>1. The debtor and the creditor may at any time agree in writing as to the events that constitute a default or otherwise give rise to the rights and remedies specified in Articles 8 to 10 and 13.</p>
<p>2. Where the debtor and the creditor have not so agreed, "default" for the purposes of Articles 8 to 10 and 13 means a default which substantially deprives the creditor of what it is entitled to expect under the agreement.</p>
<center><h4>Article 12</h4></center>
<center><h4>Additional remedies</h4></center>
<p>Any  additional  remedies  permitted  by  the  applicable  law,  including  any remedies agreed upon by the parties, may be exercised to the extent that they are not  inconsistent  with  the  mandatory  provisions  of  this  Chapter  as  set  out  in Article 15.</p>
<center><h4>Article 13</h4></center>
<center><h4>Relief pending final determination</h4></center>
<p>1.  Subject  to  any  declaration  that  it  may  make  under  Article  55, a Contracting State shall ensure that a creditor who adduces evidence of default by the debtor may, pending final determination of its claim and to the extent that the debtor has at any time so agreed, obtain from a court speedy relief in the form of such one or more of the following orders as the creditor requests:</p>
<p>(a) preservation of the object and its value;</p>
<p>(b) possession, control or custody of the object;</p>
<p>(c) immobilisation of the object; and (d)  lease  or,  except  where  covered  by  sub-paragraphs  (a)  to  (c), management of the object and the income therefrom.</p>
<p>2. In making any order under the preceding paragraph, the court may impose such terms as it considers necessary to protect the interested persons in the event that the creditor:</p>
<p>(a)  in  implementing  any  order  granting  such  relief,  fails to  perform any of its obligations to the debtor under this Convention or the Protocol; or (b) fails to establish its claim, wholly or in part, on the final determination of that claim.</p>
<p>3. Before making any order under paragraph 1, the court may require notice of the request to be given to any of the interested persons.</p>
<p>4. Nothing in this Article affects the application of Article 8(3) or limits the availability of forms of interim relief other than those set out in paragraph 1.</p>
<center><h4>Article 14</h4></center>
<center><h4>Procedural requirements</h4></center>
<p>Subject  to  Article  54(2),  any  remedy  provided  by  this  Chapter  shall  be exercised  in  conformity  with  the  procedure  prescribed  by  the  law  of  the  place where the remedy is to be exercised.</p>
<center><h4>Article 15</h4></center>
<center><h4>Derogation</h4></center>
<p>In their relations with each other, any two or more of the parties referred to in this Chapter may at any time, by agreement in writing, derogate from or vary the effect of any of the preceding provisions of this Chapter except Articles 8(3) to (6), 9(3) and (4),13(2) and 14.</p>

<center><h4>OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO REGISTRATION</h4></center>
<center><h4>Article 18</h4></center>
<center><h4>Registration requirements</h4></center>
<p>1. The Protocol and regulations shall specify the requirements, including the criteria for the identification of the object:</p>

<p>3.  Where  an  interest  registered  as  a  prospective  international  interest becomes  an  international  interest,  no  further  registration  shall  be  required provided  that  the  registration  information  is  sufficient  for  a  registration  of  an international interest.</p>
<p>4.  The  Registrar  shall  arrange  for  registrations  to  be  entered  into  the International  Registry  database  and  made  searchable  in  chronological  order  of receipt, and the file shall record the date and time of receipt.</p>
<p>5. The Protocol may provide that a Contracting State may designate an entity or  entities  in  its  territory  as  the  entry  point  or  entry  points  through  which  the information  required  for  registration  shall  or  may  be  transmitted  to  the International  Registry.  A  Contracting  State  making  such  a  designation  may specify  the  requirements,  if  any,  to  be  satisfied  before  such  information  is transmitted to the International Registry.</p>
<center><h4>Article 19</h4></center>
<center><h4>Validity and time of registration</h4></center>
<p>1. A registration shall be valid only if made in conformity with Article 20.</p>
<p>2.  A  registration,  if  valid,  shall  be  complete  upon  entry  of  the  required information into the International Registry database so as to be searchable.</p>
<p>3. A  registration  shall  be  searchable  for  the  purposes  of  the  preceding paragraph at the time when:</p>
<p>(a) the International Registry has assigned to it a sequentially ordered file number; and (b) the registration information, including the file number, is stored in durable form and may be accessed at the International Registry.</p>
<p>4. If  an  interest  first  registered  as  a  prospective  international  interest becomes  an  international  interest,  that  international  interest  shall  be  treated  as registered from the time of  registration of the prospective international interest provided  that  the  registration  was  still  current  immediately  before  the international interest was constituted as provided by Article 7.</p>
<p>5. The  preceding  paragraph  applies  with  necessary  modifications  to  the registration of a prospective assignment of an international interest.</p>
<p>6. A registration shall be searchable in the International Registry database according to the criteria prescribed by the Protocol.</p>
<center><h4>Article 20</h4></center>
<center><h4>Consent to registration</h4></center>
<p>1. An  international  interest,  a  prospective  international  interest  or  an assignment  or  prospective  assignment  of  an  international  interest  may  be registered, and any such registration amended or extended prior to its expiry, by either party with the consent in writing of the other.</p>

<p>3. A registration may be discharged by or with the consent in writing of the party in whose favour it was made.</p>
<p>4. The  acquisition  of  an  international  interest  by  legal  or  contractual subrogation may be registered by the subrogee.</p>

<p>1. Any  person  may,  in  the  manner  prescribed  by  the  Protocol  and regulations, make or request a search of the International Registry by electronic means  concerning  interests  or  prospective  international  interests  registered therein.</p>
<p>2. Upon receipt of a request therefor, the Registrar, in the manner prescribed by  the  Protocol  and  regulations,  shall  issue  a  registry  search  certificate  by electronic means with respect to any object:</p>
<p>(a) stating all registered information relating thereto, together with a  statement  indicating  the  date  and  time  of  registration  of  such information; or (b)  stating  that  there  is no  information  in  the  International  Registry relating thereto.</p>
<p>3. A search certificate issued under the preceding paragraph shall indicate that the creditor named in the registration information has acquired or intends to acquire an international interest in the object but shall not indicate whether what is registered is an international interest or a prospective international interest, even if this is ascertainable from the relevant registration information.</p>
<center><h4>Article 23</h4></center>
<center><h4>List of declarations and declared non-consensual rights or interests</h4></center>
<p>the  categories  of  non-consensual  right  or The  Registrar  shall  maintain  a  list  of  declarations,  withdrawals  of declaration  and  of interest communicated  to  the  Registrar  by  the  Depositary  as  having  been  declared  by Contracting States in conformity with Articles 39 and 40 and the date of each such declaration  or  withdrawal  of  declaration.  Such  list  shall  be  recorded  and searchable  in  the  name  of  the  declaring  State  and  shall  be  made  available  as provided in the Protocol and regulations to any person requesting it.</p>
<center><h4>Article 24</h4></center>
<center><h4>Evidentiary value of certificates</h4></center>

<p>1.  Where  the  obligations  secured  by  a  registered  security  interest  or  the obligations giving rise to a registered non-consensual right or interest have been discharged,  or  where  the  conditions  of  transfer  of  title  under  a  registered  title reservation  agreement  have  been  fulfilled,  the  holder  of  such  interest  shall, without  undue  delay,  procure  the  discharge  of  the  registration  after  written demand  by  the  debtor  delivered  to  or  received  at  its  address  stated  in  the registration.</p>
<p>2. Where a prospective international interest or a prospective assignment of an international interest has been registered, the intending creditor or intending assignee shall, without undue delay, procure the discharge of the registration after written  demand  by  the  intending  debtor  or  assignor  which  is  delivered  to  or received at its address stated in the registration before the intending creditor or assignee has given value or incurred a commitment to give value.</p>

<p>1. The Registrar shall be liable for compensatory damages for loss suffered by a person directly resulting from an error or omission of the Registrar and its officers  and  employees  or  from  a  malfunction  of  the  international  registration system except where the malfunction is caused by an event of an inevitable and irresistible nature,  which could  not  be  prevented by  using  the  best  practices  in current use in the field of electronic registry design and operation, including those related to back-up and systems security and networking.</p>
<p>2. The Registrar shall not be liable under the preceding paragraph for factual inaccuracy of registration information received by the Registrar or transmitted by the  Registrar  in  the  form  in  which  it  received  that  information  nor  for  acts  or circumstances  for  which  the  Registrar  and  its  officers  and  employees  are  not responsible  and  arising  prior  to  receipt  of  registration  information  at  the International Registry.</p>

<center><h4>CHAPTER VIII</h4></center>
<center><h4>EFFECTS OF AN INTERNATIONAL INTEREST AS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES</h4></center>
<center><h4>Article 29</h4></center>
<center><h4>Priority of competing interests</h4></center>
<p>1.  A  registered  interest  has  priority  over  any  other  interest  subsequently registered and over an unregistered interest.</p>
<p>2. The priority of the first-mentioned interest under the preceding paragraph applies,—</p>
<p>(a) even if the first-mentioned interest was acquired or registered with actual knowledge of the other interest; and (b) even as regards value given by the holder of the first-mentioned interest with such knowledge.</p>
<p>3. The buyer of an object acquires its interest in it,—</p>
<p>(a) subject to an interest registered at the time of its acquisition of that interest; and (b) free from an unregistered interest even if it has actual knowledge of such an interest.</p>
<p>4. The conditional buyer or lessee acquires its interest in or right over that object,—</p>
<p>(a)  subject  to  an  interest  registered  prior  to  the  registration  of  the international interest held by its conditional seller or lessor; and (b) free from an interest not so registered at that time even if it has actual knowledge of that interest.</p>
<p>5. The priority of competing interests or rights under this Article may be varied by agreement between the holders of those interests, but an assignee of a subordinated  interest  is not bound  by  an  agreement  to  subordinate that  interest unless at the time of the assignment a subordination had been registered relating to that agreement.</p>
<p>6. Any priority given by this Article to an interest in an object extends to proceeds.</p>
<p>7. This Convention,—</p>
<p>(a)  does  not  affect  the  rights  of  a  person  in  an  item,  other  than  an object, held prior to its installation on an object if under the applicable law those rights continue to exist after the installation; and (b)  does  not prevent  the creation  of  rights in  an  item,  other  than an object, which has previously been installed on an object where under the applicable law those rights are created.</p>
<center><h4>Article 30</h4></center>
<center><h4>Effects of insolvency</h4></center>
<p>1. In insolvency proceedings against the debtor an international interest is effective if prior to the commencement of the insolvency proceedings that interest was registered in conformity with this Convention.</p>
<p>2.  Nothing  in  this  Article  impairs  the  effectiveness  of  an  international interest in the insolvency proceedings where that interest is effective under the applicable law.</p>
<p>3. Nothing in this Article affects,—</p>
<p>(a) any rules of law applicable in insolvency proceedings relating to the  avoidance  of  a  transaction  as  a  preference  or  a  transfer  in  fraud  of creditors; or (b)  any  rules  of  procedure  relating  to  the  enforcement  of  rights  to property  which  is  under  the  control  or  supervision  of  the  insolvency administrator.</p>
<center><h4>CHAPTER IX</h4></center>
<center><h4>ASSIGNMENTS OF ASSOCIATED RIGHTS AND INTERNATIONAL INTERESTS;</h4></center>
<center><h4>RIGHTS OF SUBROGATION</h4></center>
<center><h4>Article 31</h4></center>
<center><h4>Effects of assignment</h4></center>
<p>1. Except as otherwise agreed by the parties, an assignment of associated rights made in conformity with Article 32 also transfers to the assignee,—</p>
<p>(a) the related international interest; and (b)  all  the  interests  and  priorities  of  the  assignor  under  this Convention.</p>
<p>2. Nothing in this Convention prevents a partial assignment of the assignor's associated  rights.  In  the  case  of  such  a  partial  assignment  the  assignor  and assignee  may  agree  as  to  their  respective  rights  concerning  the  related international  interest  assigned  under  the  preceding  paragraph  but  not  so  as adversely to affect the debtor without its consent.</p>
<p>3. Subject to paragraph 4, the applicable law shall determine the defences and rights of set-off available to the debtor against the assignee.</p>
<p>4. The debtor may at any time by agreement in writing waive all or any of the defences and rights of set-off referred to in the preceding paragraph other than defences arising from fraudulent acts on the part of the assignee.</p>
<p>5. In the case of an assignment by way of security, the assigned associated rights revest in the assignor, to the extent that they are still subsisting, when the obligations secured by the assignment have been discharged.</p>
<center><h4>Article 32</h4></center>
<center><h4>Formal requirements of assignment</h4></center>
<p>1.  An  assignment  of  associated  rights  transfers  the  related  international interest only if it,—</p>
<p>(a) is in writing;</p>
<p>(b)  enables  the  associated  rights  to  be  identified  under  the  contract from which they arise; and (c)  in  the  case  of  an  assignment  by  way  of  security,  enables  the obligations secured by the assignment to be determined in accordance with the Protocol but without the need to state a sum or maximum sum secured.</p>
<p>2. An assignment of an international interest created or provided for by a security agreement is not valid unless some or all related associated rights also are assigned.</p>
<p>3.  This  Convention  does  not  apply  to  an  assignment  of  associated  rights which is not effective to transfer the related international interest.</p>
<center><h4>Article 33</h4></center>
<center><h4>Debtor's duty to assignee</h4></center>
<p>1. To the extent that associated rights and the related international interest have been transferred in accordance with Articles 31 and 32, the debtor in relation to those rights and that interest is bound by the assignment and has a duty to make payment or give other performance to the assignee, if but only if,—</p>
<p>(a) the debtor has been given notice of the assignment in writing by or with the authority of the assignor; and (b) the notice identifies the associated rights.</p>
<p>2. Irrespective of any other ground on which payment or performance by the debtor  discharges  the  latter  from  liability,  payment  or  performance  shall  be effective for this purpose if made in accordance with the preceding paragraph.</p>
<p>3. Nothing in this Article shall affect the priority of competing assignments.</p>
<center><h4>Article 34</h4></center>
<center><h4>Default remedies in respect of assignment by way of security</h4></center>
<p>In the event of default by the assignor under the assignment of associated rights and the related international interest made by way of security, Articles 8, 9 and 11 to 14 apply in the relations between the assignor and the assignee (and, in relation  to  associated  rights,  apply  in  so  far  as  those  provisions  are  capable  of application to intangible property) as if references,—</p>
<p>(a) to the secured obligation and the security interest were references to the obligation  secured  by  the  assignment  of  the  associated  rights  and  the  related international interest and the security interest created by that assignment;</p>
<p>(b) to the chargee or creditor and chargor or debtor were references to the assignee and assignor;</p>
<p>(c) to the holder of the international interest were references to the assignee;</p>
<p>and (d) to the object were references to the assigned associated rights and the related international interest.</p>
<center><h4>Article 35</h4></center>
<center><h4>Priority of competing assignments</h4></center>
<p>1. Where there are competing assignments of associated rights and at least one of the assignments includes the related international interest and is registered, the provisions of Article 29 apply as if the references to a registered interest were references  to  an  assignment  of  the  associated  rights  and  the  related  registered interest and as if references to a registered or unregistered interest were references to a registered or unregistered assignment.</p>
<p>2. Article 30 applies to an assignment of associated rights as if the references to  an  international  interest  were  references  to  an  assignment  of  the  associated rights and the related international interest.</p>
<center><h4>Article 36</h4></center>
<center><h4>Assignee's priority with respect to associated rights</h4></center>
<p>1.  The  assignee  of  associated  rights  and  the  related  international  interest whose assignment has been registered only has priority under Article 35(1) over another assignee of the associated rights:</p>
<p>(a) if the contract under which the associated rights arise states that they are secured by or associated with the object; and (b) to the extent that the associated rights are related to an object.</p>
<p>2.  For  the  purposes  of  sub-paragraph  (b)  of  the  preceding  paragraph, associated rights are related to an object only to the extent that they consist of rights to payment or performance that relate to:</p>
<p>(a) a sum advanced and utilised for the purchase of the object;</p>
<p>(b) a sum advanced and utilised for the purchase of another object in which  the  assignor  held  another  international  interest  if  the  assignor transferred  that  interest  to  the  assignee  and  the  assignment  has  been registered;</p>
<p>(c) the price payable for the object;</p>
<p>(d) the rentals payable in respect of the object; or (e) other obligations arising from a transaction referred to in any of the preceding sub-paragraphs.</p>
<p>3.  In  all  other  cases,  the  priority  of  the  competing  assignments  of  the associated rights shall be determined by the applicable law.</p>
<center><h4>Article 37</h4></center>
<center><h4>Effects of assignor's insolvency</h4></center>
<p>The  provisions of Article 30  apply  to  insolvency  proceedings against  the assignor as if references to the debtor were references to the assignor.</p>
<center><h4>Article 38</h4></center>
<center><h4>Subrogation</h4></center>
<p>1. Subject to paragraph 2, nothing in this Convention affects the acquisition of associated rights and the related international interest by legal or contractual subrogation under the applicable law.</p>
<p>2. The priority between any interest within the preceding paragraph and a competing interest may be varied by agreement in writing between the holders of the respective interests but an assignee of a subordinated interest is not bound by an agreement to subordinate that interest unless at the time of the assignment a subordination had been registered relating to that agreement.</p>
<center><h4>CHAPTER X</h4></center>
<center><h4>RIGHTS OR INTERESTS SUBJECT TO DECLARATIONS BY CONTRACTING</h4></center>
<center><h4>STATES</h4></center>
<center><h4>Article 39</h4></center>
<center><h4>Rights having priority without registration</h4></center>
<p>1. A Contracting State may at any time, in a declaration deposited with the Depositary of the Protocol declare, generally or specifically:</p>

<p>(a)  they shall  be  made  available  by  the registry  authority  and  other administrative authorities, as applicable, in a Contracting State no later than five working days after the creditor notifies such authorities that the relief specified in Article  IX(1)  is  granted  or,  in  the  case  of  relief  granted by  a foreign court, recognised by a court of that Contracting State, and that the creditor  is  entitled  to  procure  those  remedies  in  accordance  with  the Convention; and (b) the applicable authorities shall expeditiously co-operate with and assist the creditor in the exercise of such remedies in conformity with the applicable aviation safety laws and regulations.</p>
