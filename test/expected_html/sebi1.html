Accordingly,  the  UPSI  period  was  from  August  18,  2020  to  12:19:19  Hrs.  on October 5, 2020. Observations/finding with respect to Noticee's status as 'insider'<li>7.7.  Noticee  was  a  consultant  working  at  Baker  Tilly.  During  the  IP,  he  was  actively exploring and evaluating various restructuring options for ECL on behalf of Baker Tilly. In this regard, it was alleged that: a.

<section>8.  The Noticee vide email dated January 08, 2024, inter alia, submitted the following reply to the SCN which is reproduced in verbatim:<blockquote>"… Charge established on incomplete analysis of facts 8.1.  At  the outset,  it  is submitted  that  the  Investigation  Report and  consequently the SCN consider an incomplete set of the facts in the present case. In the present matter, another consultant, Ernst and Young ("EY"), was initially engaged in early 2020  to  assess  and  evaluate  the  alleged  Proposed  Transaction.  Further, engagement  letters  were  also  executed  with  SRBC  (EY)  in  March  2020  to undertake  the  valuation  exercise  for  determining  the  fair  exchange  ratio  for  the Potential  Transaction.  Around  March  –  April  2020,  initial  discussions  on  the prospects of the Potential Transaction also took place with legal representatives.</blockquote>
<blockquote>8.2.  Further,  additional  consultants  like  Vivro  Financial  and  Saffron  Capital  Advisors were  engaged  for  the  process,  but  the  services  were  not  utilized.  After  some progress, the contract with SRBC (EY) was terminated in the first week of June 2020. 8.3.  Thereafter,  in  July and  August 2020, discussions were  reinitiated to explore  the Proposed Transaction. On August 18, 2020, the CFO of ECL shared an email, (i) directing the preparation for all activities related to the potential amalgamation and the review of all required information and (ii) communicating that ECL intended to convene  a  board  meeting  sometime  between  15th  to  20th  September  2020.</blockquote>
<blockquote>However, the board meeting did not take place in September 2020.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Adjudication Order in the matter of suspected insider trading activity of certain entities in the scrip of Electrosteel Castings Limited Page 6 of 25 8.4.  Subsequently, on September 09, 2020, the CFO of ECL again informed that they were  contemplating  a  board  meeting  to  consider  the  Proposed  Transaction  on October  05,  2020.  Various  engagement  letters  were  signed  on  September  19, 2020  with  the  Valuers  and  Merchant  Bankers  in  this  context.  It  was  only  on September 30, 2020, that notices for the board meeting scheduled for October 05, 2020  were  sent  to  all  directors  and  other  invitees,  and  the  trading  window  was closed on September 30, 2020.</blockquote>
<blockquote>8.5.  In light of the foregoing, it is humbly submitted that prior to September 30, 2020, discussions regarding various measures related to the Proposed Transaction were speculative, uncertain, contingent and merely exhibited a broad-based scope. At that juncture, there was no clarity regarding the definitive decision to present the Proposed  Transaction  to  the  Board  of  ECL,  let  alone  a  specific  date  for  such consideration. In the absence of any concrete or specific developments, it cannot be  established  that  the  Proposed  Transaction  was  indeed  under  active consideration.  On  September  30,  2020,  the  Noticee  was  ultimately  apprised  of scheduling the Board Meeting and Audit Committee Meeting on October 5, 2020, for deliberation of the Proposed Transaction.</blockquote>
<blockquote>8.6.  Being  so,  it  is  humbly  submitted  that  the  UPSI  concerning  the  Proposed Transaction  only  crystallized  on  September  30,  2020,  when  ECL/SPL communicated  details  concerning  the  Board  Meeting  scheduled  for  October  5, 2020. The Corporate Announcement, disclosing the Board of Directors' approval of the Proposed Transaction, was subject to various regulatory approvals, and was finally disseminated to the Stock Exchanges by ECL and SPL on October 5, 2020.</blockquote>
<blockquote>8.7.  It is pertinent to consider that the Corporate Announcement was publicly disclosed on BSE at 12:19:19 hrs and on NSE at 12:21:38 hrs. Throughout the interim period between  September  30,  2020,  till  the  public  disclosure  on  October  5,  2020,  the Noticee  did  not  engage  in  any  transaction  in  the  shares  of  ECL  which  could suggest that the Noticee traded with the intent of booking wrongful gains on the basis of UPSI.</blockquote>
<center><h4>UPSI did not crystallize prior to September 30, 2020</h4></center>
<blockquote>8.8.  It is reiterated that UPSI in the present case crystallized only on September 30, 2020,  when  ECL/SPL  communicated  details  concerning  the  Board  Meeting Adjudication Order in the matter of suspected insider trading activity of certain entities in the scrip of Electrosteel Castings Limited Page 7 of 25 scheduled  for  October  5,  2020.  Any  discussions  or  deliberations  regarding  the Proposed Transaction were simply speculative and nowhere near attaining finality especially considering the details set out in the factual conspectus. Thus, the SCN in establishing a laboured case of trading on the basis of UPSI against the Noticee, has erred in conflating access to uncertain, contingent and speculative information vis-à-vis concrete crystallized UPSI.</blockquote>
<blockquote>8.9.  In this regard, it is submitted that the Hon'ble Securities Appellate Tribunal in Pia Johnson  v.  SEBI  [Appeal No.  59 of  2020]  was  considering  a  similar matter and observed the following: "In view of the aforesaid, it is clear that the UPSI regarding purchase of an entity by IIL came into existence for the first time on March 1, 2017 when a resolution was passed by the shareholders of the Company in its EGM.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Prior to 1st March there was no inkling or indication by IIL making an offer to purchase ILPL. The discussion that was held on January 24, 2017 was only confined to a loan to be taken for ILPL from IIL.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"There is no doubt that information of sale of ILPL was in the public domain since July 15, 2016 but this information which came into the public domain was  not  treated  to  be  an  UPSI  by  the  WTM  on  the  ground  that  the resolution passed by IVL on July 15, 2017 was only a raw information and there  was  no  crystallized  offer  through  an  identified  purchaser  or ascertained  consideration  amount  for  the  purpose  of  crystallizing  the UPSI. If the information of sale of ILPL by IVL on July 15, 2016 was not a UPSI and was in the public domain then the purchase of shares by the appellants between July 15, 2016 to March 1, 2017 could not be made the basis of UPSI. We, thus, conclude that since there was no UPSI during this  period  the  trades  executed  by  the  appellants  were  not  violative  of Regulation 4(1)."</blockquote>
<blockquote>"In view of the aforesaid, we are satisfied that the appellants were not in possession  of  UPSI  when  they  purchased  the  shares  of  IVL  during  the alleged  UPSI  period  as  per  the  show  cause  notice.  In  our  view,  the appellants have successfully discharged the burden under the proviso to Regulation  4  of  the  PIT  Regulation.  Considering  the  aforesaid,  the Adjudication Order in the matter of suspected insider trading activity of certain entities in the scrip of Electrosteel Castings Limited Page 8 of 25 impugned order cannot be sustained and are quashed. The appeals are allowed with no order as to costs." 8.10. In light of the above, it is submitted that the Noticee was only privy to uncertain, speculative and contingent information which has erroneously been conflated with UPSI  in  the  SCN.  It  is  further  submitted  that  when  the  actual  UPSI  came  into existence  i.e.,  on  September  30,  2020,  when  ECL/SPL  communicated  details concerning  the  Board  Meeting  scheduled  for  October  5,  2020  till  the  Corporate Announcement on October 05, 2020, the Noticee did not engage in any transaction in the shares of ECL which could suggest that the Noticee traded with the intent of booking  wrongful  gains.  Rather,  it  was  only  when  such  information  was disseminated  to  the  public  at  large  vide  the  Corporate  Announcement,  and  the UPSI became generally available information, did the Noticee offload his position in the shares of ECL to book profits in the ordinary course of trading.</blockquote>
<blockquote>8.11. It is further pertinent to note that once the information was made public, the price of the shares had in fact declined possibly because the news was not received well by the public. In that context the act of purchasing can be considered contrary to the effect of the UPSI when it was disclosed. It is equally pertinent to consider that had the shares been held till date, the profits arising from such shares would have been much higher than what is captured in the SCN.</blockquote>
<blockquote>8.12. It  is submitted  that  the  Noticee  invested  in  the  Company  basis the  fundamental performance of the Company. If in fact the Noticee had UPSI, the Noticee would have aimed to make gains of much larger amounts and not only the meagre gains of INR 1,35,727 from the impugned trades. This in itself reflects that the impugned trades, at the highest, were speculative and not motivated by asymmetrical access to information. It belies logic to suggest that the Noticee had access to crystallized UPSI yet decided to book paltry gains.</blockquote>
<blockquote>8.13. It  is  submitted  that  the  SCN  by  resting  its  entire  purported  conclusion  on  mere conjecture and surmise has only attempted to force a conclusion which can never satisfy the test of the 'preponderance of probability' standard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Adjudication Order in the matter of suspected insider trading activity of certain entities in the scrip of Electrosteel Castings Limited Page 9 of 25 Prayer 8.14. In light of the submission made hereinabove, it is thus prayed that no penalty under Section 15G of the SEBI Act be imposed on the Noticee and thus, it is prayed that SCN be revoked with immediate effect.</blockquote>
<blockquote>8.15. Strictly without prejudice, it is further submitted that as per the regulatory scheme of the SEBI Act, the adjudicating officer has to mandatorily consider the mitigating factors  mentioned  in  Section  15-J  to  determine  the  quantum  of  penalty  to  be imposed in a given case. These are – a) the  amount  of  disproportionate  gain  or  unfair  advantage,  wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default;</blockquote>
<blockquote>b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default;</blockquote>
<blockquote>the repetitive nature of the default.</blockquote>
<blockquote>8.16. Judicial precedents of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Adjudicating Officer, SEBI  v.  Bhavesh  Pabari,  [(2019)  5  SCC  90]  have  also  established  that  such mitigating  factors  must  be  taken  into  account  by  the  adjudicating  officer  while determining  the  quantum  of  penalty  being  imposed.  The  same  has  also  been reaffirmed by the SAT in National Highway Authority of India v. SEBI [Appeal No. 232 of 2020]. In relation to the instant matter, it is submitted without prejudice to all submissions  on  merits  and  without  admitting  any  violation  whatsoever,  that  the trades in consideration was executed in the ordinary course of retail trading and no disproportionate gain or unfair advantage was made as a result of the alleged default, that no loss was caused to any investor or group of investors as a result of the default. It is also submitted that there is no document on record to suggest that any loss whatsoever has been caused to any investor as a result of the allegations levelled  in  the  SCN,  further,  the  same  has  also  not  been  alleged  in  the  SCN.</blockquote>

<center><h4>Issues</h4></center>
<blockquote>11. After  careful  perusal  of  the  material  on  record,  I  note  that  the  issues  that  arise  for consideration in the present case are as follows: I.  Whether the Noticee traded in the scrip of ECL while he was an insider of ECL and thereby violated regulation 4(1) of PIT Regulations and section 12A(e) of the SEBI Act? II.  Does the violation, if any, on the part of Noticee attract a monetary penalty under section 15G of the SEBI Act? III.  If  so,  what  would  be  the  monetary  penalty  that  can  be  imposed  upon  Noticee taking into consideration the factors stipulated in section 15J of the SEBI Act? 12. The  relevant  extracts  of  the  provisions  of  law,  allegedly  violated  by  Noticee,  are mentioned as under: PIT Regulations "4.(1) No insider shall trade in securities that are listed or proposed to be listed on a stock exchange when in possession of unpublished price sensitive information: Explanation  –When  a  person  who  has  traded  in  securities  has  been  in  possession  of unpublished  price  sensitive  information,  his  trades  would  be  presumed  to  have  been motivated by the knowledge and awareness of such information in his possession.</blockquote>

<blockquote>D.  Whether the Noticee traded in the scrip of ECL?</blockquote>
<center><h4>A.  Whether the information regarding the proposed amalgamation of SPL with ECL</h4></center>
<center><h4>was a UPSI in terms of PIT Regulations?</h4></center>
<blockquote>15. I note that regulation 2(1)(n) of PIT Regulations defines UPSI as under: "unpublished  price  sensitive  information"  means  any  information,  relating  to  a company or its securities, directly or indirectly, that is not generally available which upon becoming generally available, is likely to materially affect the price of the securities and shall, ordinarily including but not restricted to, information relating to the following: – (i) financial results; (ii) dividends; (iii) change in capital structure; (iv)  mergers,  de-mergers,  acquisitions,  delistings,  disposals  and  expansion  of  business and such other transactions; …." (Emphasis Supplied) 16. In terms of regulation 2(1)(n)(iv) of the PIT Regulations, "merger/acquisition" is covered within the definition of UPSI. Here, it is appropriate to take note of the observation of the Adjudication Order in the matter of suspected insider trading activity of certain entities in the scrip of Electrosteel Castings Limited Page 12 of 25 Hon'ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as 'SAT') in the matter of Future  Corporate  Resources  Pvt.  Ltd. and Ors.  v.  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of India1 wherein it was held that: "… 12. A perusal of the aforesaid definition would show that for an information to be termed as UPSI, it must, (i) be relating to the company or its securities either directly or indirectly; (ii) not be generally available; and (iii) likely to materially affect the price of the securities.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In terms of Regulation 2(1)(n)(iv) of the PIT Regulations, information relating  to mergers, de-mergers, acquisitions, delistings, disposals and expansion of business and such other transactions, is per se treated as UPSI. 13.  From  the  aforesaid,  it  is  clear  that  information  relating  to  merger  /  de-merger  is  not "generally available" and, therefore, it has to be treated as a UPSI. …" (Emphasis supplied) 17. It  is also  noted  that  ECL  informed  the  stock  exchanges  on  October  05,  2020  that  its board  of  directors,  at  its  meeting  held  on  October  05,  2020,  had  considered  and approved "proposed scheme of amalgamation between Srikalahasthi Pipes Ltd. (SPL) and Electrosteel Casting Ltd. (ECL)". After this announcement, the scrip ECL closed at Rs. 23.20, i.e., 4.13 % below its previous day closing price of Rs. 24.20, while touching intra-day high of Rs. 27.00 on NSE. A similar trend was also observed on BSE. Thus, it is evident that the information pertaining to the proposed amalgamation had a material effect on the price of the securities of ECL upon becoming generally available. It is also seen  that  the  Noticee  did  not  dispute  the  fact  that  the  information  pertaining  to  the proposed amalgamation, before it was published, was UPSI.</blockquote>
<blockquote>18. Accordingly,  I  find  that  the  information  about  the  proposed  scheme  of  amalgamation between SPL and ECL was an UPSI in terms of regulation 2(1)(n)(iv) of PIT Regulations.</blockquote>
<center><h4>B.  What was the period of UPSI?</h4></center>
<blockquote>Start of UPSI period 19. It is alleged in the SCN that the information regarding 'the proposed board meeting of SPL for considering the amalgamation of SPL with ECL to be held tentatively around September 15, 2020 to September 20, 2020', had come into existence on August 18, 2020. In this regard, Mr. Ashutosh Agarwal, CFO of ECL vide email dated August 18, 1Appeal No. 81 of 2021.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Adjudication Order in the matter of suspected insider trading activity of certain entities in the scrip of Electrosteel Castings Limited Page 13 of 25 2020  informed  the  CFO  of  SPL,  Company  Secretary  and  Deputy  General  Manager (Finance) of ECL,  inter alia,  that  "We are planning  to have  Board meeting  tentatively around 15th Sep to 20th Sep for considering merger approval." 20. Accordingly, the UPSI regarding the proposed scheme of amalgamation between SPL and ECL is stated to have come into existence on August 18, 2020 as per the SCN.</blockquote>
<blockquote>21. In this regard, Noticee argued that the UPSI concerning the proposed transaction had rather  crystallized  on  September  30,  2020,  when  ECL/SPL  communicated  details concerning the board meeting scheduled for October 5, 2020 to the directors. Further, Noticee contended that prior to September 30, 2020 there was no clarity regarding the definitive decision to present the proposed transaction to the board of ECL. Noticee also highlighted that the board meeting did not take place in September 2020. In this context, Noticee argued that  discussions  regarding  various measures  related  to  the  proposed transaction  were  speculative,  uncertain  and  merely  exhibited  a  broad-based  scope before September 30, 2020.</blockquote>
<blockquote>22. Here, I note that apart from the said email dated August 18, 2020, support for the fact that  UPSI  had  indeed  come  into  existence  on  August  18,  2020  comes  from  the Sequence  of  Events  (hereinafter referred  to  as  'SOE'),  i.e.,  Annexure-4  of  SCN.  The said document prepared by the ECL clearly demonstrates that despite initial discussions on the prospects of the potential transaction with legal representatives in March – April 2020 and the engagement of additional consultants, till last week of May 2020, there had been no significant progress in exploring the proposed potential amalgamation of ECL and SPL (Sr.No.29 of SOE). The turnaround happened after the conference call between  CFO  of  ECL  and  Whole-time  Director,  CFO,  Sr.GM  Finance  and  Company Secretary of SPL on June 5, 2020 (Sr.No.33 of SOE). Since the beginning of the process in March 2020, this was the first time, there had been a dialogue between SPL and ECL.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In  the  said  conference  call,  CFO  of  ECL  briefed  the  SPL  team  about  potential amalgamation of SPL and ECL. On the same date itself, the secretarial documents and draft scheme for amalgamation was shared with SPL by ECL. As per Sr. No. 35 of SOE, ECL had shared the information related to ECL and SPL to Baker Tilly vide email dated June 24, 2020 wherein one the recipients of the said email is Noticee. Subsequently, there had been a flurry of activity, including conference calls with legal team, ECL and Adjudication Order in the matter of suspected insider trading activity of certain entities in the scrip of Electrosteel Castings Limited Page 14 of 25 Baker Tilly in July and August 2020, which culminated in the email of CFO of ECL dated August 18, 2020 to both ECL and SPL teams as discussed above. Noticee participated in all these conference calls and received/sent emails in this regard.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>23. Thus, it is seen that vide the email dated August 18, 2020, the negotiations between ECL and SPL had reached a stage where of the amalgamation was almost certain as for the first time, a definite date for the board meeting in this regard was mentioned. This email asked the concerned ECL and SPL teams to prepare for all activities relating to the potential amalgamation and also informed them that the board meeting to consider the proposed amalgamation was to be scheduled sometime around September 15-20, 2020.  I  note  that  prior  to  August  18,  2020,  the  discussions  pertaining  to  the amalgamation were exploratory in nature and the information generated at that stage was  imprecise  in  nature,  without  a  reasonable  probability  of  the  transaction  going through.  However,  post  the  said  email  dated  August  18,  2020,  all  the  activities  were concentrated towards a specified objective, i.e., to ensure that the amalgamation was being  completed.  In  support  of  the  same,  it  is  relevant  to  take  note  of  the  activities undertaken post August 18, 2020 as per the sequence of events provided by ECL which has been tabulated below:</blockquote>

<blockquote>24. With regard to the submission of the Noticee that the board meeting for consideration of amalgamation did not take in September, 2020, I find it appropriate to take note of the email dated September 09, 2020 sent by Mr. Ashutosh Agarwal (CFO, ECL), wherein he had updated the status of the amalgamation process to Noticee and other connected entities: "…2 Independent Directors of SPL – Mr Abraham and Ms Hemamalini resigned from Board of SPL due to their personal reasons SPL will have 4 controlled directors of ECL and by virtue of the same, SPL board will become controlled board by ECL and hence will become a subsidiary of ECL. … SPL  will  tentatively  call  the  Board  Meeting  on  18th  Sep  to  accept  the  resignation  of  the Directors. Merger Proposed date for calling Board Meetings of ECL and SPL for approval of Merger would be 5th Oct (Monday)." (Emphasis supplied) 25. From the said email dated September 09, 2020, it is apparent that the deferral of the board  meeting  was  on  account  of  supervening  factors,  i.e.,  resignation  of  two independent  directors  of  SPL,  SPL's  board  meeting  on  September  18,  2020  for acceptance of the resignation of directors and SPL becoming a subsidiary of ECL. The deferral of the board meeting due to the said resignation had no bearing whatsoever on the overall proposal amalgamation of SPL with ECL as it clearly mentioned that proposal of  amalgamation  was  underway  and  the  proposed  date  of  the  board  meeting  for consideration of amalgamation was October 05, 2020.</blockquote>
<blockquote>26. Arguendo, if it is accepted that the UPSI came into existence on September 30, 2020, when ECL/SPL had communicated details concerning the Board Meeting scheduled for October 5, 2020, then it would amount to narrowing down the scope of the regulations.</blockquote>
<blockquote>It is conspicuous that the said email dated August 18, 2020 informed with a high degree of  certitude  to  the  concerned  employees  of  ECL  and  SPL  that  the  proposed amalgamation was in advanced stage and the board meeting of ECL for consideration Adjudication Order in the matter of suspected insider trading activity of certain entities in the scrip of Electrosteel Castings Limited Page 16 of 25 of the amalgamation proposal was scheduled in the period between September 15-20, 2020.  In  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  this  case,  the  high  level  of  certainty demonstrated in the said email dated August 18, 2020 and the flurry of activity followed lead to the only conclusion that on the basis of the said email, the UPSI had come into existence on the date of the email, i.e., on August 18, 2020. Therefore, I find that the SCN  rightly  alleges  that  the  UPSI  pertaining  to  the  amalgamation  had  come  into existence  on  August  18,  2020.  Thus,  the  contentions  raised  by  the  Noticee,  in  this regard, are untenable and bereft of merit.</blockquote>
<blockquote>27. With regard to reliance placed by Noticee on the order of Hon'ble SAT in the matter of Pia Johnson and Anr. v. SEBI2, I find that in the said case, the UPSI pertained to the 'sale' of  shares  of  India  Land  and  Properties  Limited  (ILPL) by  Indiabulls  Distribution Services Limited (IDSL) to Indiabulls Infrastructure Limited(IIL). In the said case, UPSI period, as per Hon'ble SAT, had commenced from the resolution dated March 01, 2017 which  had  authorized  the  board  of  directors  of  IIL  in  terms  of  section  186  of  the Companies Act, 2013 to invest upto Rs. 600 crore by way of grant of loan or purchase of  a  company  and  not  the  target  company  (India  Land  and  Properties  Limited) specifically. In  Pia Johnson, the appellants had disputed both the UPSI period as well as the possession of UPSI. In the said matter, Hon'ble SAT made a specific finding that the appellants were not in possession of UPSI at paragraphs 20 and 21 of the order of Hon'ble SAT dated April 8, 2022 unlike the present case. Further, in the  Pia Johnson matter,  the  information  regarding  the  sale  of  the  target  company  (India  Land  and Properties  Limited)  was  in  the  public  domain  since  July  15,  2016.  However,  in  the present  case,  the  UPSI  regarding  the  amalgamation  of  SPL  and  ECL  had  come  into existence via an email dated August 18, 2020 which asked the concerned employees to  prepare  for  potential  amalgamation  and  provided  the  tentative  date  of  the  board meeting for approval of the amalgamation. The present case is further distinguishable from  Pia  Johnson  matter  as  there  lies  no  resolution  in  terms  of  section  186  of  the Companies  Act,  2013.  Besides,  it  is  not  the  case  of  Noticee  that  the  information regarding  the  amalgamation  of  SPL  was  in  the  public  domain  in  the  present  case.</blockquote>
<blockquote>2Appeal No. 59 of 2020.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Adjudication Order in the matter of suspected insider trading activity of certain entities in the scrip of Electrosteel Castings Limited Page 17 of 25 28. These facts clearly go on to show that the information about the proposed amalgamation had crystallised on August 18, 2020 and not after. Accordingly, I find that the UPSI in the  present  case  came  into  existence  via  the  said  email  dated  August  18,  2020.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Therefore, the UPSI period commenced from August 18, 2020 as mentioned in the SCN.</blockquote>
<blockquote>End of UPSI period 29. I find that ECL had made the corporate announcement to BSE and NSE regarding the proposed  amalgamation  between  SPL  and  ECL  on  October  05,  2020.  The  said corporate  announcement  was  broadcasted  on  BSE  at  12:19:19  hrs.  and  on  NSE  at 12:21:38 hrs. Thus, the aforesaid UPSI became public on October 05, 2020 at 12:19:19 hrs.  when  said  information  was  finally  disclosed  to  the  public  through  corporate announcement by ECL on the platform of the stock exchanges.</blockquote>
<blockquote>UPSI period 30. In light of the foregoing discussions, I find that the UPSI period lies from August 18, 2020 to 12:19:19 hrs. on October 5, 2020.</blockquote>
<center><h4>C.  Whether the Noticee was an insider in terms of PIT Regulations?</h4></center>
<blockquote>31. Regulations  2(1)(d)  and  2(1)(g)  of  PIT  Regulations,  defines  'insider'  and  'connected person' as under: "… 2(1) (g)"insider" means any person who is: i) a connected person; or ii) in possession of or having access to unpublished price sensitive information; … 2(1) (d)"connected person" means- (i)any  person  who  is  or  has  during  the  six  months  prior  to  the  concerned  act  been associated with a company, directly or indirectly, in any capacity including by reason of frequent  communication  with  its  officers  or  by  being  in  any  contractual,  fiduciary  or employment relationship or by being a director, officer or an employee of the company or holds any position including a professional or business relationship between himself and the company whether temporary or permanent, that allows such person, directly or indirectly, access to unpublished price sensitive information or is reasonably expected to allow such access.</blockquote>
<blockquote>…" Adjudication Order in the matter of suspected insider trading activity of certain entities in the scrip of Electrosteel Castings Limited Page 18 of 25 32. Baker  Tilly  was  involved  in  discussions  with  ECL  since  June  2020  for  evaluation  of restructuring options and settling blueprint. It is noted from the disclosure dated October 05, 2020 made by ECL on the stock exchanges that Baker Tilly was the financial adviser for the proposed amalgamation. The Noticee was a consultant working at Baker Tilly in the  capacity  of  being  its  partner  during  the  UPSI  period  wherein  he  was  actively exploring and evaluating various restructuring options for ECL on behalf of Baker Tilly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Therefore, it is not in dispute that the Noticee was a 'connected person' within the ambit of regulation 2(1) (d) of the PIT Regulations and thus, an insider of ECL under regulation 2(i)(g) i) of the PIT Regulations.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>33. Though it is established that the Noticee is an insider by virtue of being a connected person  as  explained  above  under  2(i)(g)  i)  of  the  PIT  Regulations,  in  this  case,  it  is curious to note that there is evidence to establish that Noticee is insider within the ambit of regulation 2(i)(g) ii) of the PIT Regulations too. The emails that Noticee received close to  the  announcement  of  the  proposed  amalgamation  were  recorded  in  the  SCN/ Investigation  Report.  As  explained  in  paragraph  22  above,  Noticee  participated  in  all conference calls and received/sent emails with respect to the amalgamation since June 24,  2020.

Further, he had prepared  various  documents  including  a  draft  of  pre  board  meeting  activity  schedule with ECL regarding the proposed amalgamation of SPL with ECL. Thus, the Noticee, by the  virtue  of  his  position  in  Baker  Tilly,  was  privy  to  critical  details  pertaining  to  the proposed amalgamation which were not generally available. Noticee in his reply has not disputed  that  he  has  received/sent  the  above  mentioned  emails  along  with  their attachments as mentioned in Table 2.</blockquote>
<blockquote>35. Accordingly, I find that Noticee was an insider with respect to proposed amalgamation in terms of regulation 2(1)(g) of PIT Regulations being in direct possession of UPSI in addition to being a connected person by being associated with an entity who advised on the said amalgamation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>37. From  the  abovementioned  Table  3,  it  can  be  seen  that  100%  of  the  shares  of  ECL bought by Noticee falls in the UPSI period. I also note that the Noticee had purchased 19,003  shares  of  ECL  during  the  UPSI  period  via  trades  executed  on  six  days  as tabulated above. Thereafter, Noticee sold the said 19,003 shares of ECL on the date of announcement,  i.e.,  on  October  05,  2020  only  after  the  information  regarding  the amalgamation was disseminated over the stock exchanges. Noticee, vide the aforesaid trades undertaken in shares of ECL, had earned a profit of Rs.1,35,727/- (Rupees One Lakh Thirty-Five Thousand Seven Hundred Twenty Seven Only).</blockquote>
<blockquote>38. On  analysing  the  trading  data  of  Noticee,  it  is seen  that  Noticee  did  not  execute any trade in the scrip of ECL from May 2019 to August 25, 2020. However, during the UPSI period, the scrip of ECL was Noticee's highest traded scrip which contributed to 38.78% of his total trading.</blockquote>
<blockquote>39. The  Noticee  has  contended  that  his  trades  in  the  scrip  of  ECL  were  driven  by  the fundamental performance of the company. Having gone through the said contention, I find that such a contention may appear to be appealing on its face, on an examination of the same, the defense put forward by the Noticee is found to be grossly untenable and lacks merit to be accepted. In this regard, it is seen that the justification tendered by the Noticee is found to be lacking in sufficient evidence to demonstrate that he was driven by the financial performance of ECL. There is no evidence brought on record to even suggest that he had undertaken any analysis of the scrip of ECL. Therefore, I see no reason to accept the present justification of the Noticee and am constrained to record that the Noticee does not succeed in refuting the insider trading charge against him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>40. Further, the Noticee has stated that once the UPSI was made public, the price of the share of ECL had declined as the news was not received well by the public. Noticee has submitted that the act of purchasing can be considered contrary to the effect of the UPSI Adjudication Order in the matter of suspected insider trading activity of certain entities in the scrip of Electrosteel Castings Limited Page 21 of 25 when it was disclosed. Here, I note that the moot issue involved is whether the Noticee had traded in the scrip of ECL while in possession of UPSI. As noted above, it has been established that the Noticee was an insider during the UPSI period. The out-of-character trading pattern followed by Noticee in the scrip of ECL is writ large on its face itself to indicate that the trades of Noticee were influenced by the possession of UPSI. In this regard,  it  is  crucial  to  take  note  of  the  order  of  Hon'ble  SAT  in  the  matter  of  Ameen Khwaja & Ors. v. SEBI4, stated that "34.  The  burden  of  proof  of  having  reasonable  expectations  of  having  access  to  UPSI  is initially  on  respondent  SEBI. Once the respondent  SEBI  placed material/probabilities then onus to prove shifts to the other side i.e. the appellants to prove otherwise. Since, admittedly, respondent SEBI is required to establish the facts on preponderance of probability and not beyond reasonable doubt, the similar standard of proof would apply to the appellants to shift the onus…" 41. In  this  context,  applying  the  regulatory  provisions  surrounding  the  charge  of  insider trading, I am of the view that as it has been established that Noticee traded in the scrip of ECL while he was an insider and  in possession of UPSI, now the Noticee has the burden to demonstrate that he was not in possession of the above noted UPSI or that his trading in the shares of ECL during the UPSI period when he was in possession of the  said  UPSI  was  squarely  covered  under  any  of  the  exonerating  circumstances provided under regulation 4(1) of the PIT Regulations. However, the Noticee instead of discharging the burden in terms of the extant PIT Regulations, tried to justify his trade on the ground of negative reaction of the market and his fundamental analysis of the scrip of ECL. Accordingly, I find the instant submission of the Noticee lacking in merit.</blockquote>
<blockquote>42. In  light  of  the  discussions  in  the  previous  paragraphs,  there  is  no  dispute  that  the Noticee, being an insider had traded in the scrip of ECL while in possession of UPSI.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Moreover, his trading pattern confirms the nature of UPSI, as he had purchased shares in the scrip of ECL prior to the disclosure of the amalgamation of SPL with ECL. The records  before me  also  show  that  the  Noticee  had  not  traded  in  the  scrip  of  ECL for more than a year prior to the UPSI period and suddenly, during the UPSI period, the Noticee not just traded in the scrip of ECL rather the said scrip of ECL was his highest traded scrip. It is also a fact that the Noticee has also failed to demonstrate that he was 4 Appeal No. 584 of 2019.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Adjudication Order in the matter of suspected insider trading activity of certain entities in the scrip of Electrosteel Castings Limited Page 22 of 25 not in possession of UPSI, or any of the available defences in terms of regulation 4(1) of the PIT Regulations are attracted.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>43. The most glaring fact in the whole gamut of these proceedings is that there is an explicit bar  on  the  employees  of  Baker  Tilly  to  trade  in  the  share  of  its  clients.  During  the investigation, SEBI sought the Code of Conduct adopted by Baker Tilly as per regulation 9(2) of the PIT Regulations. Baker Tilly vide email dated December 10, 2022 provided relevant extracts of its Code of Conduct which reads as under: "You  are  prohibited from  using  or  sharing  information  not  publicly  disclosed  which you obtain  during  the  course  of  your  work  for  the  Employer,  for  your  personal  gain  or advantage in securities transactions, or for the personal gain or advantage of anyone with whom you improperly share this information. This restriction applies to such information related to any company not just the Employer's clients and their affiliates. The forgoing obligation is in addition to any obligation that you are outright debarred from purchasing or  holding  securities  of  entities  with  respect  to  which  the  Employer  must  maintain independence. To make the thing abundantly clear you are outright debarred from dealing in shares and securities with the Employer's client (present or past, regular or non-regular).(Bold and underline supplied) 44.  It is alarming to note that the Noticee being a partner in Baker Tilly had bought and sold shares of ECL (and made profit in the process), while he was a connected person and that too while in possession of UPSI. Irrespective of these, the Noticee has tried to justify his trades as above, which in my opinion, cannot be accepted. Based on the foregoing discussions,  it  is  established  that  the  Noticee  had  violated  regulation  4(1)  of  PIT Regulations and section 12A(e) of the SEBI Act.</blockquote>
<center><h4>II.  Does the violation, if any, on the part of Noticee attract a monetary penalty under</h4></center>
<center><h4>section 15G of the SEBI Act?</h4></center>
 <blockquote>45. As  it  has  been  established  that  the  Noticee  has  violated  regulation  4(1)  of  PIT Regulations and section 12A(e) of the SEBI Act, the Noticee is liable for payment of a monetary penalty in terms of section 15G of the SEBI Act. The text of the above said section 15G of the SEBI Act is reproduced below:</blockquote>
<center><h4>SEBI Act</h4></center>
<blockquote>"15G. Penalty for insider trading.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>If any insider who, — Adjudication Order in the matter of suspected insider trading activity of certain entities in the scrip of Electrosteel Castings Limited Page 23 of 25 (i) either on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person, deals in securities of a body corporate  listed  on  any  stock  exchange  on  the  basis  of  any  unpublished  price-sensitive information; or (ii) communicates any unpublished price-sensitive information to any person, with or without his  request  for  such  information  except  as  required  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business  or under any law; or (iii) counsels, or procures for any other person to deal in any securities of any body corporate on the basis of unpublished price-sensitive information, shall be liable to a penalty which shall not be less than ten lakh rupees but which may extend to twenty-five crore rupees or three times the amount of profits made out of insider trading, whichever is higher" III.  If so, what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed upon the Noticee taking into consideration the factors stipulated in section 15J of the SEBI Act? 46. While  determining  the  quantum  of  penalty  under  section  15G  of  the  SEBI  Act,  the following factors stipulated in section 15J of the SEBI Act have to be given due regard:</blockquote>
<center><h4>SEBI Act</h4></center>
<blockquote>"15J. Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer While adjudging quantum of penalty under Section 15-I, the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors, namely: - (a)  the  amount  of  disproportionate  gain  or  unfair  advantage,  wherever  quantifiable, made as a result of the default;</blockquote>
<blockquote>(b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default;</blockquote>
<blockquote>(c) the repetitive nature of the default." 47. I note that material available on record does not bring out any loss caused to any specific investor  or  a  group  of  investors,  as  a  result  of  violations  committed  by  Noticee  with respect to UPSI. I note that there is no material available on record to indicate that the violations  committed  by  Noticee  are  repetitive.  Noticee  had  made  a  profit  of Rs.1,35,727/- (Rupees One Lakh Thirty-Five Thousand Seven Hundred Twenty Seven Only) while trading in shares of ECL, when in possession of UPSI. In this regard, I have taken note of the fact that the said profit made by the Noticee has been remitted to the SEBI Investor Protection and Education Fund.</blockquote>

In the present case, the Noticee, on account of his professional relationship with Baker Tilly, had asymmetrical access to the UPSI regarding the proposed amalgamation that placed him at an unfair advantage over the others in the market and undermined the level-playing field for trading in the scrip of ECL during the UPSI period.</blockquote>
