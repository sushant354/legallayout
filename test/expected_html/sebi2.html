 In the matter of Raima Equities Private Limited</td>
<center><h4>Background:</h4></center>
<section>1.  Raima Equities Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as the 'Noticee/REPL') is registered  as  a  Broker  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India (hereinafter referred to as "SEBI"). The present proceeding is originating from the Enquiry  Report  dated  June 28,  2024,  submitted  by  the Designated  Authority (hereinafter referred to as "DA"), in terms of the applicable provisions of the SEBI (Intermediaries)  Regulations,  2008  (hereinafter  referred  as  "Intermediaries Regulations”).</section>
</section>
<section>2.  SEBI  had  conducted  an  inspection  of  the  Noticee,  during  August  21,  2023  to August 24, 2023 for the inspection period April 2022 to July, 2023 to examine the possible violation of the provisions of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (SEBI Act), Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957 (SCR Rules) and NSE Circulars, etc.</section>
<section>3.  During  the  inspection,  SEBI  observed  that  the  Noticee  had  invested  in  group companies namely K B R Township Pvt Ltd. and Kanodia Finance Pvt Ltd. (group companies), amounting to Rs. 42,49,180 and Rs. 35,15,000, respectively, in the stock exchange. The relevant details of the said investment of the Noticees are as under;<table border="1" class="dataframe">

<section>4.  The inspection findings lead to the alleged violation of the provisions of Rule 8(3)(f) of SCR Rules and NSE Circular No. NSE/COMP/50957, dated January 07, 2022.</section>
<section>5.  Accordingly, a Designated Authority (DA) was appointed to inquire into the matter under  the  Intermediaries  Regulations  and  submit  a  report  pertaining  to  the aforesaid allegations. The DA issued a show-cause notice (hereinafter referred to as  "SCN")  dated  May  07,  2024  to  the  Noticee  under  Regulation  25(1)  of  the Intermediaries Regulations to show cause as to why appropriate recommendation should  not  be  made  against  under  Regulation  23  of  Chapter  V  read  with Regulation 26 of the Intermediaries Regulations read with Section 12(3) of SEBI Act for the alleged violations.</section>
<section>6.  After considering the allegations levelled in the SCN, reply filed by the Noticee, providing  an  opportunity  of  personal  hearing  and  considering  the  material available on record, the DA, submitted the aforesaid Enquiry Report dated June 28, 2024 and made the following recommendation:<center><h4>________________________________________________________________________________</h4></center>
<center><h4>Enquiry Order in the matter of Raima Equities Private Limited                                                                Page 2 of 11</h4></center>
</section>
<section>7. Thereafter,  a  P ost-Enquiry  Show  Cause  Notice  dated  July  15,  2024 (hereinafter referred to as "Post Enquiry SCN") was issued by the Competent Authority to the Noticee enclosing a copy of the Enquiry Report dated June 28, 2024,  while  calling  upon  it  to  show  cause  in  terms  of  Regulation  27  of  the Intermediaries  Regulations  as  to  why  actions  as  recommended  by  the  DA should not be taken against the Noticee in terms of the said Regulations.</section>
<section>8. I note that the said Post Enquiry SCN was issued to the Noticee through SPAD and  e-mail  dated  July  15,  2024,  which  were  duly  delivered.  The  Noticee confirmed  the  receipt  of  the  e-mail  vide  its  e-mail  dated  July  22,  2024. Thereafter, vide e-mail dated August 05, 2024, the Noticee had filed its reply in the matter to the Competent Authority. Subsequently, the Noticee was granted an  opportunity  of  personal  hearing  on  October  24,  2024  vide  e-mail  dated October 10, 2024. During the said personal hearing on October 24, 2024, the Noticee  sought  one  week's  time  to  file  its  post  hearing  reply  in  the  matter. Accordingly, the Noticee was  granted time to written submissions till October 30, 2024. Accordingly, the Noticee submitted its written submissions vide e-mail dated  October  30,  2024. The  summary  of  the  replies  dated  August  05,  2024 and October 30, 2024 submitted by the Noticee are as under; •  There is no violation of the SCR Rules as it was not engaged as "principal or Employee" nor as a Broker or agent. •  NSE is not a competent authority to issue the Circular dated January 07, 2022. •  Noticee further submitted that the NSE circular dated January 07, 2022 provides  a  clarification  to  Rule  8  (3)  (f)  of  the  SCR  Rules  and  is  not retrospective in nature and is only applicable to activities undertaken by members  after  the  date  of  the  circular.  So,  no  violation  occurs  if  the investment is prior to the period of January 07, 2022 and after the said date the Noticee complied with the  circular. In this regard, the Noticee has  relied  upon  the  Supreme  Court cases  of  CIT  vs.  Vatika Township (p.)  Ltd.  [2014]  49  taxmann.com249/227  Taxman  121,  Govinddas  vs.<center><h4>________________________________________________________________________________</h4></center>
<center><h4>Enquiry Order in the matter of Raima Equities Private Limited                                                                Page 3 of 11</h4></center>
 04.01.2022). •  Since the disinvestment was done on January 23, 2024 and January 27, 2024, with respect to the alleged investments no violation existed as on May 7, 2024, when the SCN was issued. •  Further,  the  Noticee  submitted  that  in  the  past  SEBI  has  initiated Adjudication  Proceedings  in  certain  similar  cases  where  monetary penalty  has  been  imposed  instead  of  resorting  to  proceedings  under Regulation  26  and  Regulation  27  of  the  Intermediaries  regulation. Therefore, consistent treatment has not been meted out to the Noticee. In this regard the Noticee has relied upon the case of Joy vs. Regional Transport Authority – 1998 (10) TMI 129 (HC), wherein the Hon'ble High Court of Kerala has held that judicial discipline demands consistency in rendering  judgments.  A  judicial  officer  may  hold  different  views  on various aspects. A judicial Officer may err and pass contradictory orders inadvertently.  But  once  it  is  brought  to  the  knowledge  of  the  Judicial Officer, he is duty bound to keep track of inconsistency. •  The Noticee submitted that the alleged violation was minor, technical and in compliance of law as on date. Therefore, the proposed suspension of registration  is  very  harsh  and  not  proportionate  to  alleged  violation.  In this regard, the Noticee has relied upon the cases of Brickwork Ratings India  Pvt.  Ltd.  vs.  SEBI  dated  June  06,  2023  and  Satellite  Corporate Services Pvt. Ltd. vs. SEBI. •  The  Noticee  submitted  that  there  is an  inordinate delay  of  11  years  in initiating  this  proceeding,  which  is  prejudicial  to  its  interest  because despite having the knowledge of the investments made in the year 2013- 14  and  carrying  out  several  inspections  since  then.  In  this  regard  the Noticee has referred to the case of Mahendra Lal Das vs. State of Bihar And Ors, 2001 Supp(4) SCR 157, dated October 12, 2001, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that "Inordinate long delay can be taken as presenting proof of prejudice.", the case of Anil Finature Pvt. Ltd. vs. SEBI in its order dated 08.11.2023,  Hon'ble SAT held that in that matter<center><h4>________________________________________________________________________________</h4></center>

 order dated January 31, 2020 the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that</section>
<section>9. Thereafter,  pursuant  to  the  change  of  the  Competent  Authority,  another opportunity of hearing was granted to the Noticee on June 18, 2025 which the Noticee chose to attend virtually. During the said hearing, the Noticee sought for  time  till  June  27,  to  file  additional  submissions  in  the  matter,  which  was granted. Accordingly, the Noticee vide e-mail dated June 27, 2025 submitted its additional submissions dated June 25, 2025, in the matter. The summary of the said reply is as under; •  The Noticee submitted with respect to the investment made by it in equity shares  of  group  Companies,  it  has  already  explained  that  it  was  not engaged in any other business by virtue of making such investment and has not used clients' funds. •  The  Noticee  also  submitted  the  term  'any  business'  mentioned  in  rule 8(1)(f), 8 (3)(f) of SCR Rules was not clearly defined.  This resulted in the issuing clarifications for their trading members, through circulars which gave an illustrative list of activities that are construed as non-compliance to rule 8(1)(f), 8 (3)(f) of SCR Rules. However, these circulars seem to have expanded the scope of the term 'any business' mentioned in rule 8(1)(f), 8 (3)(f) of SCR Rules. Therefore, a consultation paper was floated by the central government in this regard, requesting for public comments. Accordingly,  pursuant  to  consideration  of  the  comments  of  the stakeholders,  the  central  government  issued  a  notification  dated 19.05.2025 amending rule 8(1)(f), 8 (3)(f) of SCR Rules. •  Then, the Noticee submitted that the said legislative changes clarify the meaning about what constitutes 'business' in terms of Rule 8 filling the will have retrospective effect. Investment made  out of  Clients' funds  or  securities  is to be  treated  as • business which will be in violation of Rule 8(3)(f) of SCR Rules. •  Therefore,  there  is  no  violation  of  Rule  8(3)(f)  of  the  SCR  Rules. Accordingly, proceedings may be closed. •  Noticee  submitted  that  amendments  of  this nature are  retrospective  in operation.   Accordingly, Noticee submitted case laws, i.e. CIT vs. Vatika Township P Ltd., Income Tax Officer Vs. Vikram Sujitkumar Bhatia, Zile Singh Vs. State of Haryana in support of its case.</section>
<center><h4>Consideration and Findings:</h4></center>
<section>10. Considering  the  factual  findings  from  the  inspection,  the  allegations  levelled against the Noticee in the SCN and the Post Enquiry SCN including the Enquiry Report dated June 28, 2024, based on such findings and the explanations offered by the Noticee through oral hearing and written replies in the matter, I find that the following issue requires consideration;</section>
<section>11. I note the Noticee, in essence submitted the following arguments relating to the Rule 8(3)(f) of the SCR Rules.<ul>
<li>a) The  investments  in  question  were  made  in  the  year  2013  in  two  group companies.  The  Noticee  neither  engaged  as  a  "principal  or  employee"  nor acted as a broker or agent in the said group companies where the investments were  made.  These  investments  did  not  give  rise  to  any  personal  financial liability on the part of the Noticee.<li>b) The investments were made exclusively from the Noticee's own surplus funds as  the  Noticee  engaging  in  a  principal  business  activity  other  than  that  of securities.<li>c) National Stock Exchange (NSE) has no power to issue the impugned circular dated January 07, 2022. Even otherwise, the said NSE circular merely provides a clarification to Rule 8(3)(f) of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules and applies  prospectively  to  activities  undertaken  after  its  issuance.  Since  the investments in question were made in 2013, well before the circular's date, it has no retrospective applicability, and hence, no violation arises.<li>d) Further, the disinvestment of the said investments was completed on January 23, 2024, and January 27, 2024. Accordingly, as on the date of issuance of the Show Cause Notice dated May 7, 2024, the Noticee was not holding any such investments, and therefore, no violation can be said to subsist.<li>e) The  term  "principal  business"  is  not  defined.  What  constitutes  "principal business"  will  depend  on  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  each  case. Memorandum,  Articles  of  Association  of  the  company,  past  history  of  the company, etc., will help in determining the principal business of a company.</li>
</li>
</li>
</li>
</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>12. Before dealing with the argument of the Noticee, it is important to bring out the interpretation  of  Rule  8(3)(f)  of  the  SCR  Rules  as  amended  on  May  19,  2025, limited to the relevant facts of this case. The analysis of the amended provision of the Rule 8(3)(f) of the SCR Rules brings out the following;<ul>
<li>a)  In order to come within the preventive breach of the above rule, there should be  an  engagement  by  the  Noticee  either  as  principal  or  employee  in  any business other than that of securities or commodity derivatives  except as a broker or agent not involving any personal financial liability. As  interpreted by the  Hon'ble  Madras  High  Court in  The  Madras  Stock  Exchange  Limited  vs S.S.R. Rajakumar, on 25th February 2003;<li>b)  Rule 8(3) (f) of the SCR Rules also provides for categories of exception under Rule 8(3) (f) (i), (ii) and (iii).<li>c)  The  amendment  made  a  clarification  on  what  cannot  be  construed  as business stating that investments made by a member shall, at all times, not be construed as business except when such investments involve client funds or  client  securities,  or  relate  to  arrangements  which  are  in  the  nature  of creating  a  financial  liability  on  the  broker.  The  rule  as  amended  is  shown below, ________________________________________________________________________________ Enquiry Order in the matter of Raima Equities Private Limited                                                                Page 1 of 11 "….having regard to orderly functioning of the securities market and protection of interest of investors, I recommend that the certificate of registration of Noticee i.e., Raima  Equities  Private  Limited,  SEBI  Registration  No:  INZ000263832,  be suspended for a period of one month in terms of Regulation 26 (1) (iii) of SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008." "…..on account of inordinate delay in the initiation of the proceedings by issuance of show cause notice, the quashing of the penalty order by the Hon'ble  Securities  Appellate  Tribunal  was  not  interfered  with  by  the Supreme Court." ________________________________________________________________________________ Enquiry Order in the matter of Raima Equities Private Limited                                                                Page 5 of 11 Whether  the  Noticee  has  violated  Rule  8(3)(f)  of  SCR  Rules,  given  the amendment dated May 19, 2025 on the said provision of law? ________________________________________________________________________________ Enquiry Order in the matter of Raima Equities Private Limited                                                                Page 6 of 11 "The first part prohibits the Member of the Exchange from being the principal ________________________________________________________________________________ Enquiry Order in the matter of Raima Equities Private Limited                                                                Page 7 of 11 securities,  provided  he  does  not  incur  any  personal  financial  liability  by functioning as such broker or agent." "  (8)  The  rules  relating  to  admission  of  members  of  a  stock  exchange seeking recognition shall inter alia provide that … … (3) No person who is a member at the time of application for recognition or subsequently admitted as a member shall continue as such if— … … (f) he engages either as principal or employee in any business other than that of securities or commodity derivatives except as a broker or agent not involving any personal financial liability, provided that— (i) the governing body may, for reasons, to be recorded in writing, permit a  member  to  engage  himself  as  principal  or  employee  in  any  such business, if the member in question ceases to carry on  business  on the stock exchange either as an individual or as a partner in a firm, (ii) in the case of those members who were under the rules in force at the time of such application permitted to engage in any  such  business and  were  actually  so  engaged  on  the  date    of    such    application,  a period of three years from the date of the grant of recognition shall be allowed for severing their connection with any such business, (iii)  nothing  herein  shall    affect    members    of    a    recognised    stock ________________________________________________________________________________ Enquiry Order in the matter of Raima Equities Private Limited                                                                Page 8 of 11 Provided further that investments made by a member shall, at all times, not  be  construed  as  business  except  when  such  investments  involve client funds or client securities, or relate to arrangements which are in the nature of creating a financial liability on the broker.” d)  Therefore, the amendment clarifies that if investments made by the Member satisfies  both  the  following  conditions,  such  investments  are  out  of  the prohibitive ambit of Rule 8(3) (f) of the SCR Rules, because such investments won't be construed as business. i.  Such investments do not involve client's funds and securities or ii.  Such investments do not relate to arrangements which are in the nature of creating a financial liability on the Member e)  The  investment  made  by  the  member  would  still  fall  within  the  preventive sweep of Rule 8(3) (f) of the SCR Rules if such investment does not satisfy any one of the above two conditions. Further, the clarification is limited only to  the  investments  made  by  the  member  and  does  not  cover  any  other business  if  such  business  is  not  by  virtue  of  investments  made  by  the member. f) In view of the clarification on what won't be construed as business under Rule 8(3) (f) of the SCR Rules, investment in the group companies by Noticee will fall outside the ambit of business, if the activities are investments and such investments do not involve client's funds and securities and such investments do not relate to arrangements which are in the nature of creating a financial liability on the Noticee. Therefore, if notices investments are to fall outside the scope  of  "business",  the  investment  in  group  companies  should  satisfy  the above mentioned two conditions. 13. The essence of the findings of DA as inferred from the report dated June 28, 2024 is that there was investment by the Noticee in the group companies in the year 2013  as  alleged  and  such  investment  was  not  incidental  to  securities  or ________________________________________________________________________________ Enquiry Order in the matter of Raima Equities Private Limited                                                                Page 9 of 11 NSE/COMP/50957 dated January 07, 2022. Accordingly, the DA recommended that  the  certificate  of  registration  of  Noticee  be  suspended  for  a  period  of  one month. 14. In the instant case, I note that whether the impugned investment is from client's funds or securities or such investment relates to an arrangement in the nature of creating a financial liability is not part of inspection findings. Further there is no allegation  that  the  Noticee's  investments  in  the  two  group  companies  involve client's funds and securities or that the investments in the group companies relate to arrangements which are in the nature of creating a financial liability. Needless to say, since there was no such case, the DA Report dated June 28, 2024, also does not have any findings with respect to it. 15. In  order  to  sustain  the  instant  proceedings  before  me  given  the  clarifying amendment dated May 19, 2025, on Rule 8(3) (f) of the SCR Rules, existence of the allegations and an adverse finding on two conditions in the DA report is pre- requisite.  As  stated  earlier,  the  same  is  not  the  case.  However,  post  the amendment,  SEBI  has  conducted  an  examination  and  found  that  the  two conditions  mentioned  in  para  12(d)  are  satisfied.  i.e.  (a)  investments  do  not involve client's funds and securities and the source of funds for investment  being the  accumulated  reserves  and  (b)    investments  do  not  relate  to  arrangements which are in the nature of creating a financial liability on the Member.  I also note that the Noticee has submitted that the funds in the instant case of investment was from their own funds and does not involve client's funds and securities. 16. In  view  of  the  above  discussion,  the  investment  of  the  Noticee  cannot  be construed as business. Consequently, the allegation of violation of Rule 8(3) (f) of the SCR Rules against the Noticee cannot be sustained.  I also note that NSE has issued circular dated June 10, 2025 post the amendment dated May 19, 2025 with  the  following  clause  "In  view  of  the  above  amendment,  Point  No.  10  of Exchange  Circular  Ref  No.  NSE/COMP/50957  dated  January  07,  2022  and ________________________________________________________________________________ Enquiry Order in the matter of Raima Equities Private Limited                                                                Page 10 of 11 17. Since no adverse finding on Rule 8(3) (f) of the SCR Rules has been given in this order against the Noticee, the other aspects raised by the Noticee in the instant proceedings in his reply do not require separate consideration. Directions:</li>
<blockquote>18. In  view of  the foregoing, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me in terms of  Section  19  of  SEBI  Act,  1992  read  with  Regulation  27  of  the  Intermediaries Regulations,  I,  hereby  dispose  the proceedings  against  Raima  Equities  Private Limited, having SEBI Registration Number – INZ000263832 without any adverse action.</blockquote>
<blockquote>19. This order comes into force with immediate effect.</blockquote>
<blockquote>20. A copy of this order shall be forwarded to the Noticee.</blockquote>
